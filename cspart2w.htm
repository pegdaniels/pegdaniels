<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><a name="CS8"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele once again resisted the urge to chew on his lip. Easy, mate. If Murphy wants to
sit here all night in inhospitable silence, so be it. I know what you&#8217;re up to, Miss Holt.
Babysittin&#8217; me. No doubt you&#8217;ll take turns sittin&#8217; up with me each night. Well, you&#8217;ll be
the ones losin&#8217; sleep, not I.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He settled back in the car seat and closed his eyes. Murphy wouldn&#8217;t expect him to
stay awake, anyway. What a day.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He&#8217;d slept in until noon, only to be awakened by Miss Holt buzzing away at the
doorbell like a blackfly at uncovered flesh. She&#8217;d insisted he come interview Wallace&#8217;s
crew with her. He&#8217;d persuaded her to first let him make a bit of lunch for them: some
vegetable soup, sandwiches. He hadn&#8217;t wanted to go out&nbsp;&#8211; his face was too well
known. At any other time he&#8217;d have revelled in his celebrity, no matter how unjustly
deserved, but now it&#8217;d become notoriety. Soon after he started preparing the meal, a
group of policemen invaded his apartment with a warrant to search it for the stolen
items. They&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>destroyed </i>his apartment. His sofa and bed mattress were ripped open,
his posters and paintings removed from their frames and tossed carelessly about,
camera dismantled, film containers opened, curtain rods unscrewed, linings and hems
of coats and trousers and suit jackets ripped open, contents of drawers and closets
and cabinets searched and dumped into heaps. The plants on his balcony were
knocked out of their pots, their roots explored &#8211; he doubted they&#8217;d survive the
damage. They tracked in the dirt all over the carpet, all over every room.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Canisters of flour and sugar were emptied. Food from the refrigerator was smashed
with forks to make sure no ruby lay inside. They even took his pot of soup from the
stove, strained its contents, and poked through it.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And his videotapes. He&#8217;d just started collecting them, though he hadn&#8217;t yet plucked
up his courage to actually go buy one of those videocassette player gizmos and try to
figure out how to set it up, or, better yet, soap someone else into doing it for him. But
he&#8217;d wanted to be prepared. Well, so much for that: they ruined his entire collection.
They opened up the shell of every single one, and &#8216;Casablanca,&#8217; &#8216;The Third Man,&#8217; &#8216;The
Thirty-nine Steps&#8217;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all lay in ribbons, a big heap on the floor. Laura was furious,
and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he just stood there. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; he said, not sure
if the mantra was directed at Laura or himself. He looked again at the pile of rubbish.
He might as well set a match to it. To the whole place. When had he developed this
sense of ownership, this sense of attachment, that he should feel so violated?</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He winced at the sound of something breaking in the kitchen, but stayed put. Let
them do their worst&nbsp;&#8211; they wouldn&#8217;t find anything. As if he&#8217;d ever be so stupid as to
hide stolen items in his apartment. Laura panicked, digging her fingernails into him as
she asked him about his passports. He assured her he&#8217;d already removed the passports from
the premises. It wouldn&#8217;t do for the police to start checking into the backgrounds of
Michael O'Leary, Paul Fabrini, John Murrell, Douglas Quintain, and Richard Blaine.
Somehow he didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d be willing to accept that Remington Steele just liked
to have false passports in the names of Humphrey Bogart characters.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Finally, after some last, angry words for the police, Laura had dragged him from the
chaos, and they&#8217;d taken up their interviews of the crew, the silence weighing heavily
between them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele sighed. He didn&#8217;t feel like going back to the apartment. Well, he&#8217;d check into a
hotel tomorrow&nbsp;&#8211; he might have to be moving on anyway. He found himself chewing
on his lip and stopped himself. C&#8217;mon, mate. Quit thinkin&#8217; these thoughts&nbsp;&#8211; they&#8217;re
hardly relaxin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t give Murphy the satisfaction of seeing you rattled. Turn your
mind to somethin&#8217; more pleasant and drop off like the babby</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"> he&#8217;s supposed to be
mindin&#8217;. That&#8217;ll get his knickers in a twist.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He searched his mind and came up with the perfect bedtime thought. In fact, he
nearly started laughing. He thought of Carl, remembering the two of them working
together in Raeder&#8217;s Museum Room. They&#8217;d been able, sometimes with difficulty, to
behave appropriately when others were around, restricting themselves to shooting
each other furtive glances, but occasionally they were left to themselves and propriety
went out the window. Sometimes, Carl would parody a ballet dancer as he&#8217;d sweep
down the aisles, his hands gracefully brushing against the exhibits. Steele would
follow him, preferring to just slide across the polished floor in stockinged feet,
pretending to be Gene Kelly in &#8216;Singing in the Rain&#8217; (Gene Kelly, Donald O&#8217;Connor,
Debbie Reynolds. MGM. 1952), though he didn&#8217;t drop to his knees&nbsp;&#8211; he would&#8217;ve, had
he thought he, too, would end up at the amazing legs of Cyd Charisse. One time, Carl
persuaded him to demonstrate an Irish step dance &#8211; well, he didn&#8217;t admit to Carl he
was pretty much making up the steps since he&#8217;d never been properly taught. Carl
would never know: keep your upper body still, kick up your legs, look like you&#8217;ve got
a poker shoved up your backside, and you&#8217;re doing an Irish dance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But most of the time when they were alone and taking a break, they&#8217;d just go around
gaping in awe, pointing out to each other some piece they were particularly fond of,
not trying to hide the lust it inspired. Then, someone would enter, and they&#8217;d once
again fall into their assumed roles. Although, it&#8217;d been a bit awkward the time he&#8217;d
ended up half a room away from his shoes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy looked over at the sleeping figure. Jeez, was that a smile on the guy&#8217;s face?
Well, Murphy would give him one thing: if he&#8217;d done this, he sure had balls, sticking
around like this. Murphy had expected that even if the guy were innocent, being a
suspect would&#8217;ve been enough to send him running.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The con man sure didn&#8217;t seem too concerned they were staking out this Carl guy. Not
that that meant anything. The only thing you could be sure about with con men was
that nothing was as it seemed. He&#8217;d learned that when he was eighteen.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Irritated not only at having to stake out a guy who Steele could probably tell them the
whereabouts of, but also at having to put up with Steele, his candidate for the thefts,
sound asleep next to him, Murphy reached over Steele to pull a notebook out of the
glove compartment. He slammed the compartment shut.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele&#8217;s eyes flew open. He jerked upright in the seat and looked around wildly to see
where the shots were coming from, only to see Murphy pulling back from his
direction, his hand still on the glove box. Their eyes met. Never hesitating to go where
angels might fear to tread when it came to Murphy, Steele plunged right in as if they&#8217;d
been having a casual conversation all along. &#8220;So, when did you first decide to put on
the mantle of a PI?&#8221; For a moment he thought Murphy might refuse to speak to him,
but then again, Murphy had never shown any signs of fearing to tread on Steele,
unless Laura was around. He suppressed a sigh of relief when Murphy started talking.
Always worse than being abused was being ignored.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;When I was eighteen, after I was conned.&#8221; Murphy&#8217;s voice was hard.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele couldn&#8217;t help the small smile that formed on his lips. &#8220;Eighteen. That means you
were still in high school? I saw your personnel records&nbsp;&#8211; you went to George
Washington High School, named after that chap who could never tell a lie. I thought
that explained a lot.&#8221; He again couldn&#8217;t keep a small smile of amusement off his face.
Murphy shot him an irritated look before turning back to Carl&#8217;s house. When Murphy
remained silent, Steele raised his hand in a conciliatory gesture. &#8220;My apologies. Would
you tell me the story?&#8221; He did his best to project an air of openness and interest.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy shifted in the seat, then shot Steele another quick glance. After another
interval of silence, Murphy spoke. &#8220;I&#8217;d recently graduated from high school. I wanted
to get out of Denver, away from mom and dad, like any kid.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Well, not <i>any</i> kid. First, you needed parents. &#8220;That&#8217;s when you came to California?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Straight to USC. First week there, I met a girl, took her to the first weekend dance. I
got her to leave the party early and wander about the city with me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Good show!&#8221; But he knew Murphy wasn&#8217;t letting all this slip out of a sense of
camaraderie. From the very start of this story, Murphy&#8217;s tone let Steele know there was
a point to it. A very sharp point.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;We were crossing a street, and up ahead we could see a man coming down the
sidewalk, slowly making his way toward us, stumbling a bit. He was older, maybe late
twenties, early thirties, and he was drunk. Happy drunk. &#8216;I love everyone&#8217; drunk. He
stumbled coming off the curb and I rushed to help him.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Naturally.&#8221; Steele kept his tone neutral, but it didn&#8217;t matter. Murphy&#8217;s voice when he
resumed speaking held barely suppressed anger; he seemed too involved in his story
to pay attention to Steele for the moment.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The drunk greeted me as if I were his long-lost cousin.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And then when you&#8217;d gotten halfway down the block, you realized your wallet had
been lifted. You whirled around, only to find the drunk had magically discovered
coordination and disappeared into the night.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy glanced at him, eyes blazing. &#8220;Sounds like you&#8217;re familiar with the ploy.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s one a pickpocket might use to survive on the streets,&#8221; Steele responded coolly.
Just a way to keep from starving when one had no other means. &#8220;Nothing personal. To
incite such passion in you, though, I take it that it didn&#8217;t have a salutary effect on your
date.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You could say that.&#8221; Murphy bit off the words. &#8220;Some nights I&#8217;d go back to that street,
hoping to run into that &#8216;drunk&#8217; again.&#8221; Murphy fell into a brooding silence.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Even though&nbsp;&#8211; or maybe, because&nbsp;&#8211; his companion obviously didn&#8217;t want to elaborate,
Steele wasn&#8217;t inclined to drop his line of inquiry. Surely there was more to this story,
surely Murphy hadn&#8217;t yet said what he&#8217;d really wanted to let fly. He phrased his goad
for maximum effect. &#8220;So. A desire to avenge yourself on the lowly pickpockets of the
world for having spoiled your first date led you to become a PI.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy turned on him angrily, his voice low and intense. &#8220;Not long after that I learned
firsthand that scammers usually prefer frailer victims than me. That same year, my
seventy-year-old grandma was the target of a pigeon drop in a supermarket parking
lot in Florida. After she&#8217;d withdrawn some money, she became suspicious and refused
to give it to the cons. They beat her and took it and never were caught.They beat her
for $300. <i>That&#8217;s</i> when I decided I wanted to bring felons like that to justice. I&#8217;ve been
in this business for ten years, I&#8217;ve traveled all around the U.S., and you know what?
Everywhere I go, I find con men. I know all about you. Your languages vary, but what
comes out of your mouths is deceit. You&#8217;re masters at manipulating your victims.
You&#8217;re seldom caught, hardly ever convicted, but when you are, you manipulate the
cops, the judges, the parole officers. You&#8217;ve all shown not only can crime pay, it pays
very well.&#8221; Murphy threw a pointed look at Steele&#8217;s attire. &#8220;And while you&#8217;re sitting
pretty, not giving a damn about right and wrong, believing yourself superior to your
victims, to everyone who believes in the law &#8211; hell, to everyone who&#8217;s not a clever
confellow like you&nbsp;&#8211; another family loses their life&#8217;s savings because they were
gullible, another old man is declared incompetent and put into a nursing home
because he was naive, another old lady is beaten because she caught on too late.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy&#8217;s eyes bored into his. &#8220;Every time I hear of one of you getting caught, I
celebrate, and whenever I catch one of you myself, I go out to a nice secluded beach
and scream at the top of my voice, &#8216;That&#8217;s for you, Grandma.&#8217;&#8221; Murphy turned abruptly
away from him and resumed staring at Carl&#8217;s house. &#8220;She loved the ocean.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele turned his head to look out the front window. He had to consciously untense
his shoulders. He glanced at Murphy&#8217;s profile, then looked down at his own lap, not
really seeing anything, having to blink several times because something was blurring
his vision. He could think of nothing to say.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><a name="CS9"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele heard Laura greet Bernice and go into her office. He massaged the back of his
neck. He&#8217;d gotten a crick in it after finally falling into an uneasy sleep in Murphy&#8217;s car
last night. He stared at the door connecting his office to Laura&#8217;s. He rolled down his
sleeves, fastened his cuffs, put his suit jacket on, and adjusted his tie. He walked to
Laura&#8217;s door, knocked, opened it, and stuck his head inside. &#8220;Miss Holt, may I speak
with you a moment?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He didn&#8217;t wait for her answer, but left the door open and returned to sit behind his
desk. He heard Murphy enter Laura&#8217;s office and tell her that nothing had happened
during the stakeout last night, that he was going to write up some of his notes before
heading out again to interview more of the party attendees, and that no one had yet
reported seeing anyone who might&#8217;ve bumped into Ms. Raeder.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura came into Steele&#8217;s office and proceeded to wear a hole in the carpet. Her &#8216;this
better be good&#8217; look definitely marred her unstudied beauty.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, I once knew this contessa who pulled a jewellery scam. I&#8217;ve been wondering if
the same thing could&#8217;ve happened here.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura glanced at him, looked away, then stopped pacing to look at him more fully, her
features slightly less forbidding, but her arms still crossed in front of her.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What if, what if the ruby wasn&#8217;t stolen? I mean, what if Ms. Raeder staged the theft?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Go on.&#8221; Laura&#8217;s tone was neutral.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;She could&#8217;ve snapped the chain herself, hidden the ruby in her, uh, dress. What if,
what if they faked the theft to collect the insurance money? It&#8217;s been done. What if the
Raeders have some outstanding debts and they&#8217;re unable to pay? Or rather, unwilling
&#8211; they don&#8217;t want to part with their treasures.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s shoulders relaxed. She came over to lean her arms on his desk. &#8220;A man with
the resources of Mr. Raeder&nbsp;&#8211; he could have access to people who could break into
your display case&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It was one of the first ones we worked on. They had nearly three weeks to figure it
out. Maybe they had little spy cameras or bugs to help them, or they just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. solved
the puzzle. Any system can be breached given sufficient time and resources.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura sighed. &#8220;The ruby and mosaic could be anywhere by now.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager they&#8217;re still on their premises. Raeder likes to be personally in control. I
think he&#8217;d keep them in his possession. Trust me, I know the type.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The premises were searched.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;By Raeder&#8217;s men.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And the police.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they were a lot more careful with his belongings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they didn&#8217;t
search the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. safest places.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She stared at him. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t get a search warrant served based on this.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll search it ourselves. And not just the safes. That place was built during
Prohibition. There&#8217;s a secret bar he&#8217;s converted into a niche to hold artwork&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; He
trailed off as he saw her look, then continued bravely. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the library. I came across
it during my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my investigation of the premises&nbsp;&#8211; for security purposes,&#8221; he added
hastily.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Was it empty?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura. You&#8217;re assuming I checked.&#8221; He tried to sound hurt, but under her continued
stare he couldn&#8217;t help breaking into a grin. &#8220;Yes, it was empty at the time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;re suggesting we break into their mansion, into their safes, and search for the
ruby and the mosaic.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; As she turned away, he hurried to say, &#8220;It&#8217;d be child&#8217;s play, Laura. I know the
security systems, inside and out. A fact that has thus far been used against me. Let
me make it work for me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She turned back to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give the matter all the consideration it deserves, Mr.
Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">His eyes followed the long line of her legs as she strode purposefully out of his office,
then he scowled, swung his chair around, clasped his hands behind his head and
stared out the window. Things were rubbing along about as smoothly as fingernails on
a blackboard.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As Laura marched into Murphy&#8217;s office to collar him, Murphy swivelled his desk chair
around to face her. &#8220;Murphy, we need to dig more into the background of the
Raeders. <i>Top</i> priority.&#8221; Steele&#8217;s intuitions, while often out of the blue and not always
correct, always led their cases forward, toward resolution. Unless, this time, he was
just leading them on.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What, specifically, are we looking for?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Any reason they&#8217;d report those items missing while actually keeping them for
themselves&nbsp;&#8211; insurance fraud, business difficulties.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy grinned at her. &#8220;The Raeders pulling a scam.&#8221; His grin disappeared and he
jerked his head in the direction of Steele&#8217;s office. &#8220;I bet I know who gave you that idea.
After his performance during your interviews yesterday, why do you trust anything he
says?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of trust, Murphy. I know it&#8217;s not the first thing we&#8217;d normally look at,
but it&#8217;s a good idea. It bears checking out.&#8221; Murphy&#8217;s look told her he thought she was
clutching at straws.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Finally, Murphy shrugged and leaned back in his chair. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take time. Raeder&#8217;s had
that mansion out here for a while, as well as business offices, but he hasn&#8217;t really lived
here before now. His base of operation has been New York. The important stuff&#8217;s
going to be back there. If we&#8217;re talking federal information, it could take weeks. And
the man&#8217;s business dealings are international. We could be looking a long time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I can help there.&#8221; Steele was leaning in the doorway where he&#8217;d managed to
inconspicuously park himself.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Adding eavesdropping to your list of sins?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele straightened up. &#8220;That would appear to be the least of my worries, Murphy.
Anyway, I can help.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;How.&#8221; Not a question. A statement of flat-out disbelief.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Always the skeptic, Murphy. Every source of information is vulnerable to a good ruse.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura stopped Murphy from retorting with an admonishing shake of her head.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele was, as usual, oblivious to the exchange. &#8220;Also, Mr. Raeder is quite the art
collector. I&#8217;m sure I can contact certain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brokers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to find additional information
on our man. As for Ms. Raeder, well, of course I prefer the personal approach&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll let you concentrate on <i>Mr</i>. Raeder, Mr. Steele,&#8221; Laura broke in as he
grinned. She paced a few steps, feeling a resurgence of energy. &#8220;Do you know when
the Raeders married?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;About a year ago, she told me. Said it was love at first sight,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; Steele shrugged and
lifted his eyebrows, conveying his opinion that he didn&#8217;t see what Ms. Raeder could&#8217;ve
seen in Erich&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;said they married after a whirlwind romance.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;All right. You two see what you can find out on Mr. Raeder, and I&#8217;ll concentrate on
Ms. Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She noticed Murphy eyeing Steele with his old distrust. Also as of old, Steele was
ignoring it, saying, &#8220;By the way, old boy, the best time to call to talk your way into
closed information is 12:01 local time. The management is out to lunch, leaving the more malleable clerks and secretaries to run the world. Give
me a shout if I can be of service.&#8221; She hoped Murphy would take him up on it. She
knew Murphy hated to admit it, but at this kind of thing Steele could be very&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Useful and Diligent. She smiled to herself at the reference</span></span>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As Steele left the room, she turned to Murphy. Her unassuming, shoot-from-the-hip
partner had contacts all over the U.S. from his freelance days, and she had need of
them. &#8220;Murphy, what&#8217;s the number for your investigator friend in New York? Ed
Something-or-other.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ed Hines. Sure, I&#8217;ve got the number right here.&#8221; Murphy flipped through his Rolodex.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give him a call.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura shook her head and copied down the number. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get it. Thanks, Murph.&#8221; As
Laura went into her office, she heard a burst of laughter come from Steele&#8217;s office.
Unable to resist, she cracked open his door. There was Steele, on the phone, lounged
back in his chair, feet on his desk, a hand waving expansively, smiling and laughing.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ah, yes, Henri. It&#8217;s been too long, too long. And how is Joelle?&#8221; Steele&#8217;s voice
caressed the name. He noticed Laura and waved her in, but she declined. She had
better things to do than listen to him discuss some woman while conversing long-distance with a &#8211; what had he called it? broker?&nbsp;&#8211; fence, more likely.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She went to her desk and picked up the phone to dial New York. She got Ed&#8217;s
secretary, who said Ed was in with a client but should be finished soon. Laura told the
secretary to mention Murphy was her partner, knowing that would speed Ed&#8217;s return
call. As she set down her phone, she could hear Murphy&#8217;s voice come through the
wall. He was probably on the phone speaking to some bureaucrat about the Raeders&#8217;
current insurance policies and past claim histories. She smiled, picturing Murphy
hunched over his small, neat-as-a-pin desk, frowning in concentration at the notepad
in front of him, scribbling furiously.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The office phone rang, and Bernice punched through the call from Ed. Laura explained
the situation as briefly as possible and hired him to start a background check on Ms.
Raeder. She grimaced at the expenditure, but this was a time for frugality to take a
back seat to speed. Now, what next? Ms. Raeder was new here, so likely no close
friends to pump. Laura drummed her fingers on her desk. She&#8217;d try the household
staff, though they&#8217;d probably choose to face a firing squad rather than give her any
dirt on the Raeders and face<i> their</i> wrath. Given the coldness Laura felt when she was
around the two, she could understand that choice. But, worth a try. She picked up the
phone and called Ms. Raeder. The line was busy. Well, she&#8217;d just go out there.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As she left her office, Murphy stalked past her, heading for Steele&#8217;s office. &#8220;What&#8217;s
wrong, Murph?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy glowered at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got Ms. Raeder on the phone, trying to get some
information from her. She wants to speak with <i>him</i>.&#8221; Murphy jerked his head in the
direction of Steele&#8217;s office.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura smiled a little and shook her head. &#8220;Well, suck it up and let him speak to her.
Tell him what you want. I want to see her anyway &#8211; I&#8217;ll talk to her now to set up an
appointment and then turn her over to you two.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy chuffed a breath and turned to go into Steele&#8217;s office. Poor Murph. She could
imagine Steele apologizing to Ms. Raeder for Murphy&#8217;s inexperience in dealing in such
matters&nbsp;&#8211; but what could he do?&nbsp;&#8211; the boy had to learn sometime as part of his
training to be a PI. Lord knows, it rankled her enough when Steele did that sort of
thing to her. She knew Murphy found it nearly intolerable.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura was escorted into the Breakfast Room of the Raeder mansion where Ms. Raeder
was having a late brunch. Ms. Raeder gave her the smile of a woman who knows not
only that she is beautiful, but that the woman she is greeting is no rival in that
department. Laura gritted her teeth. Ms. Raeder swept her hand out, indicating Laura
should join her at the table. As Laura sat, maids brought in trays with orange juice&nbsp;&#8211;
freshly squeezed, no doubt&nbsp;&#8211; milk, coffee, a selection of teas, fresh baked croissants
and muffins, toast, a selection of marmalades and jams, yogurt, smoked salmon on
cream cheese bagels in nests of dill, and fresh fruit compote&nbsp;&#8211; Laura could smell the
vanilla bean in the sauce. What army was the woman planning to feed? It was obvious
by her figure she must live on air.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But no, evidently Ms Raeder had a voracious appetite. Laura thought caustic thoughts
as to how the woman worked it off. Laura selected some of the compote, to be polite;
she had no intention of staying long. &#8220;Ms. Raeder, I&#8217;ve just finished speaking with your
household staff again. Thank you for instructing them to give me their full
cooperation.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ms. Raeder nodded indulgently.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;This is everyone who&#8217;s ever worked for you, correct?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ms. Raeder raised a perfect eyebrow. &#8220;Yes, during the day we have five maids, a cook,
and a butler. That&#8217;s everyone.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Now, according to my notes, your entire staff, except for the cook and a maid, came
with Mr. Raeder when he made his final move here &#8211; which was two weeks before <i>your</i>
arrival.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ms. Raeder&#8217;s bagel halted its journey to her mouth and resumed its position on her
plate. &#8220;I made do with the limited staff.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;According to your cook and maid, you cancelled your flight reservation and arrived
two days later than you&#8217;d originally planned. But you sent the cook and the maid on
that original flight.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ms. Raeder picked up the bagel and her perfect, even teeth took a healthy bite out of
it before she answered. &#8220;Guilty as charged, Miss Holt. I had some things in New York
to wrap up. Do you have a point?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m just wondering if you hired anyone to do the routine chores those last two days. A
temp, perhaps.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why is this important, Miss Holt?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Just dotting all my i&#8217;s and crossing all my t&#8217;s, as Mr. Steele taught me.&#8221; With the
smoothness of long practice, Laura managed not to grind out that last part. If, as
Bernice said, Ms. Raeder thought Steele &#8216;prime something,&#8217; the mention of his name
might bring greater cooperation. &#8220;You never know&nbsp;&#8211; maybe that temp holds a grudge
against you or Mr. Raeder, has some connections you&#8217;re not aware of.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ms. Raeder sniffed. &#8220;I doubt that very much. But if you must know, I &#8216;borrowed&#8217; the
services of a girl who works for one of Erich&#8217;s attorneys&nbsp;&#8211; she doubled as cook and
maid those last two days. Dreadful girl.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Could I get her name and a contact number for her, please.&#8221; Laura didn&#8217;t inflect her
voice as a question. She noted the tiny wrinkle that appeared on Ms. Raeder&#8217;s
otherwise perfect forehead as the woman looked at her with ill-concealed annoyance.
Ms. Raeder got up from the table, swept from the room, and went through the door
from the Dining Room to the Library. She soon returned with an address book in her
well-manicured hand.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura took down the information and handed the book back. Ms. Raeder picked up
one of the small brass bells on the breakfast table, rang it, then again left the room to
go into the Library. While she was in there, the butler came to escort Laura out of the
mansion. For Laura, evidently, brunch was over. She checked her watch. Almost noon.
A client had arranged to meet her for lunch today to go over the wrap-up of his case.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Since she had to pass by the office anyway, she stopped in to check her messages to
see if Ed had called with any information. Not yet. She opened the main door to
Steele&#8217;s office to see what he was up to. Her first glimpse revealed Murphy pacing
back and forth. Then she saw Steele at his desk, feet on the floor, posture erect,
speaking into the phone to someone about the possibility of insurance fraud, the need
for utmost discretion. He spoke earnestly, then cajolingly, then he melted into the
chair and spoke suggestively to the obviously female recipient of his call. He finished
with a soft laugh and a silky, &#8220;It&#8217;s been a pleasure speaking with you, and, yes, I&#8217;d be
delighted to repay the favour and pleasure you.&#8221; He handed the phone to Murphy,
evidently having been put through to the source Murphy was after. Steele saw Laura
and gave her a slight smile and a wink. She gave a tight nod and closed the door,
picturing him following up on his promise. &#8216;Why, Laura,&#8217; she imagined him saying, &#8216;it
was all in the line of duty. I gave my word. And Remington Steele&#8217;s word is his bond.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura swished out of the suite, nearly knocking Bernice over as she came into the
office with sandwiches for the men.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele polished off his BLT, goat cheese, avocado, and basil on a toasted roll sandwich.
As soon as he was sure Laura was safely out of the building, he grabbed his coat to
leave. Murphy, on hold, called out, &#8220;Where are <i>you</i> going?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Off to see friends.&#8221; Steele gave Murphy a backward wave, refraining from taking in
the picture of Murphy standing frustrated at the phone, wanting to pursue him yet
unable to do so&nbsp;&#8211; Murphy would never reach the person on the other end of the line
without Steele&#8217;s help again; Murphy just didn&#8217;t have enough artifice in his bones.
Steele gave Bernice a beatific smile, which she returned with a less-than-beatific
scowl, and slipped out the door.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Out on the Avenue of Stars, Steele spotted the tails immediately. Jenkins needed to
lose some weight; the only way he&#8217;d keep up with Steele was if Steele left a trail of
donuts. Steele took a taxi to the Grand Central Market, nice and crowded at this time
of day. Jenkins and his partner were easily lost, probably gorging themselves on
burritos. Steele got his friend Amistad to take him to La Placita Olvera</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">. He slipped
into the back of the Art Gallery to wait while Amistad delivered a message for him. He
could only hope the message&#8217;s recipient would show up.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">A half hour later he decided his friend thought him way too hot for his message to
make any difference. In his message, he&#8217;d called in the marker owed him concerning

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Just as he was about to give up and move on to his next source, the familiar voice

platforms served more pigeons than passengers. He caught a taxicab on Alameda to
his next destination, in West Hollywood. Afterwards, he&#8217;d try to check with some of his
other local sources about Raeder&#8217;s standing in the art world, but he doubted he&#8217;d
learn anything more. Mando was his most reliable source on these matters, and
Mando hadn&#8217;t told him anything he hadn&#8217;t already suspected. Still, it was good to have
confirmation.</span></span></p>

blame Mando&nbsp;&#8211; if the current situation wasn&#8217;t resolved in Steele&#8217;s favour, all the
treasures of &#8216;his man&#8217; would remain buried.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele shook his head in amazement. To think, he owed his discovery of these
treasures to a fluke. He&#8217;d taken the silver out of the oak canteen and, out of habit,
had checked under the royal blue velvet lining for a false bottom. He couldn&#8217;t have
been more startled when, after some careful probing, he&#8217;d actually found one. All that
had lain inside it was an old photograph with the inscription &#8216;Regelheim, Northeim.&#8217;
Funny thing was, it&#8217;d stirred a memory.</span></span></p>

places and had a knack for hooking just what he needed. They got clothes, shoes&nbsp;&#8211;
even a duffel bag in which they could pack their few possessions. They also took the
opportunity while there to wash up in a sink in the employees&#8217; loo.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">In the early morning they started to hitch to Coventry, Amish&#8217;s hometown. On the
way, Amish once again insisted on telling him about John Hewitt, the Director of the
Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. Amish had the mistaken belief Nevan
should be interested in Hewitt because Hewitt was Irish. A famous Irish poet. Nevan
couldn&#8217;t get it through Amish&#8217;s thick skull he had no interest in a Protestant from the
North.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Let me read to you some of his poetry, yes?&#8221; Amish pulled a book and a few papers
out of the duffel while Nevan groaned. Actually, Nevan didn&#8217;t mind that much. Amish
was educated; he could read&nbsp;&#8211; even write English in those curly letters. And Nevan
liked to hear Amish&#8217;s soft voice, which came from deep in his throat. Amish&#8217;s voice
sounded so musical anyway, but especially when he spoke poetry. Amish planned on
being a poet himself one day. Nevan planned on staying alive.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Nevan lay in the back of the lorry with his head on the duffel bag. He looked up at the
sky and tried to see animals and faces in the fluffy white clouds. He tuned in and out

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They entered a dining room. A spotless white carpet covered the floor. The children
and their father sat around a rectangular table of gleaming wood. There was a little
carving on each corner of the table&#8217;s apron. The legs of the table were tapered and
formed with ridges like a reed. The chairs were all a match to the table. The backs of
the chairs were artistically shaped; their tops were arched and had roses carved into
them. Nevan had never before been in such a grand home. Well, at least not for any
purpose other than a smash-and-grab.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Saeed&#8217;s father said something to the little children, and with lots of giggling, they
rearranged themselves so Saeed and Nevan were seated next to each other. Nevan
decided the best thing about the chairs were their comfy cushions. He stopped
himself from bouncing up and down on them. Saeed&#8217;s grandmother brought in place
settings for them, and then the feast began.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Nevan ate silky dal, rice that smelled like perfume, spicy-sweet date chutney, crisp
curried potatoes with peas, crunchy cucumbers in yogurt, mouth-puckering lime
pickle, and soft chappati. Everyone scooped up their food on their chappatis, which
was a relief since it&#8217;d been awhile since Nevan had used knife and fork. Throughout
the meal, Saeed&#8217;s mother and grandmother would appear with fresh chappati.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;More, yes, Nevan?&#8221; Saeed&#8217;s mother urged him. Nevan nodded his head vigorously,
wondering why the women didn&#8217;t eat with the rest of the family.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">For dessert, there was a sweet with paper-thin foil pressed onto it. &#8220;It is real silver,&#8221;
Saeed whispered to him. Nevan looked at him open-mouthed and thought his eyes
would pop out of his head when he saw Saeed eat the silver.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Finally, when Nevan really <i>was</i> afraid the food would soon be coming out of his ears,
they were served a small cup of liquid. &#8220;Digestive lassi,&#8221; Saeed told him.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Nevan looked at the thinned, beaten yogurt with cumin, ginger, salt, and coriander
leaves. He put a hand to his belly. &#8220;I hope it works.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Several hours later he dropped to his knees in front of the toilet in the loo off Saeed&#8217;s
bedroom. He should&#8217;ve known a belly so unused to this quantity and variety of food
would rebel against it. But it&#8217;d tasted so good.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Good Morning, Nevan,&#8221; Saeed sang.</span></span></p>
<br>

with raisins and nuts, some fruit, some griddle-baked bread with cashew butter, and a
yogurt drink with mint. Nevan was hungry, having lost most of last night&#8217;s food, but
restrained himself, not wanting a repeat performance. He watched as Saeed dug into
his food. How could Saeed give all this up to stand with him outside of chippers</span></span>

passion braided with sadness, as a couple, Raj and Nargis, madly in love with each
other, underwent tragedy after tragedy until they were finally united as they were
meant to be. Nevan&#8217;s favourite line was, &#8216;Love, which comes like rain, brings with it

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Nevan wrinkled his face. &#8220;That&#8217;s a picture of a British soldier in front of a castle. I don&#8217;t

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I broke into the attic of Mr. Barclay months ago, the last time I was here. I found the

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It&#8217;d seemed a fair deal: Saeed could try to make use of Nevan&#8217;s connection to Daniel in

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But before they&#8217;d been able to come up with a plan to liberate the silver, fate had
intervened. He&#8217;d never been sure what had happened&nbsp;&#8211; all he knew was he&#8217;d
awakened that night to hear a lot of yelling and screaming. Finding himself alone in
Saeed&#8217;s bedroom, he&#8217;d pulled on his trousers, shrugged into his shirt without
buttoning it, and crept out to see what was going on, only to see Saeed being beaten
by his father. Saeed had scrambled out of the house. Nevan had flown back into the
bedroom, flung open the window, swung himself out of it, and, after briefly hanging
onto the ledge by his fingertips, dropped down a floor to the ground. He&#8217;d knocked

and searched for Saeed for a while. When first light had threatened, he&#8217;d given up,
and barefoot&nbsp;&#8211; his shoes had still been in the foyer of Saeed&#8217;s family&#8217;s house&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d
started the journey back to Brixton.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He&#8217;d never seen his friend again. He hoped his friend was somewhere writing poetry.
And what of that antique silver? Had Saeed nicked it after all, and it&#8217;d somehow ended
up in L.A.? After all these years, to have opened a canteen of silver and seen a
photograph of what Steele was almost sure was the same castle with the same British
soldier in front of it seemed nothing short of fantastic. He couldn&#8217;t say for sure
whether the script on the picture Saeed had shown him had also said &#8216;Regelheim,&#8217;
since he&#8217;d been barely able to read at the time, but Saeed <i>had </i>said that there were two
pictures in the canteen and that he&#8217;d taken only one. If the picture Saeed had shown
him and the one Steele had found in the oak canteen were indeed identical, ironic the
silver that had once eluded his grasp in Coventry had ended up here in L.A., back
once again within the reach of Nevan. Or Desco. Or whatever he chose to call himself
when the time came.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shook his head and stared out the window as the cab turned onto the tree-lined
residential cul-de-sac. Seeing that photo had piqued his curiosity, and he&#8217;d kept a
sharp eye out for other questionable items among the display objects. He&#8217;d come
across a few possibilities&nbsp;&#8211; and one definite reality, though it hadn&#8217;t been on display.
He&#8217;d also learned that the nearby Greystone Mansion, built during Prohibition, had
secret bars, and that it was likely many mansions in the area had them. So he&#8217;d
expanded his search and had found some, as well as a labyrinth of secret passages.
The passages had led to tunnels and rooms &#8211; cells, really. Each such chamber had had
sterile, climate-controlled air and had been empty of everything except what his
imagination had filled it with.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The taxi stopped. He got out and kicked at the sidewalk in discontent. All further hunt for
treasure was on hold now. He sighed. Well, maybe he could find some more dirt on the Raeders
to dish to Laura and Murphy. He went into the three-story, Mediterranean-styled Sunset Marquis
Hotel, where the rich and famous recharged after a debauch in the nearby Sunset Strip clubs. But
the area had its further enticements. There was the nearby Hollywood Bowl, where in the film,
&#8216;Olly Olly Oxen Free&#8217; &#8211; Katharine Hepburn, Kevin McKenzie, Dennis Dimster, Peter Kilman,
Sanrio Communications, 1978 &#8211; Kate had landed a hot-air balloon by herself in front of the stage
during a performance of the 1812 Overture. And of course other legendary stars had appeared
there &#8211; Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Mickey Rooney, Edward G. Robinson, Al Jolson, Judy
Garland, Fred Astaire. Also close-by was the Tiffany Theatre, a wonderful cinema, which, like the
NuArt and the Fox Venice, ran classic films. Universal Studios was nearby. And there was the
Hollywood Walk of Fame and Mann&#8217;s Chinese Theatre with its giant, red pagoda, a huge dragon
writhing up the fa&ccedil;ade, two lion-dogs guarding the main entrance, and tiny dragons offering their
protection from evil spirits from the ridges of the theatre's ornate, copper roof. The Chinese
Theatre, with its footprints of the stars, was the site of more gala Hollywood movie premieres
than any other theatre.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But, this hadn&#8217;t been the time to indulge in such diversions.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He went to his hotel room and, after a brief freshening up, went back down to the
lobby. After checking for possible tails, he went out into the courtyard to the poolside
alfresco Patio Caf&eacute; and nodded at Huela, a big-boned German girl. Huey had the
manner of the sweetest creature on God&#8217;s green earth, but she looked like she could
flatten a man.</span></span></p>

him, did you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Things were so much easier when I didn&#8217;t have to worry if my &#8216;boss&#8217; is the one
committing the crimes I&#8217;m investigating,&#8221; Laura muttered as she entered her office.
She picked up the phone and dialed a New York number. &#8220;Mrs. Richthofen? My name
is Laura Holt. I&#8217;m a private investigator in Los Angeles, and I&#8217;m working on a case
involving some thefts at the Raeder mansion out here&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s self-introduction to the Raeders&#8217; former neighbor was interrupted by honks of
laughter. &#8220;Oh my, yes. I heard about that. Lora lost her ruby.&#8221; More mirthful laughter
followed; Laura couldn&#8217;t help her own smile. No love lost here.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Mrs. Richthofen finally quieted down. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Ms. Holt. Erich is the perfect
gentleman, and I <i>am</i> sorry about his difficulties. But what he sees in that little tramp,
I&#8217;ll never know.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I understand your maid worked for Ms. Raeder the two days before she came to L.A.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Is she somehow trying to pin this on my Melisenda? Listen, Melisenda never stole that
money from that slut. My poor girl&#8217;s been so upset I had to give her the week off&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Money?&#8221; Laura could hear Mrs. Richthofen take a deep breath, evidently trying to calm
herself.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Lora Raeder accused my Melisenda of taking money from her that last day. Melisenda
has worked for me for fifteen years. She is not a thief.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I believe you, Mrs. Richthofen&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The nerve of that little gold digger. I swear, I don&#8217;t understand why Erich puts up with
her. She just spends all his money and coquets with anything in pants. If it weren&#8217;t for
that prenup, I doubt she&#8217;d stop at undressing every man she sees with her eyes &#8211;
she&#8217;d use her teeth! Erich should just dump her.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Meeooww. &#8220;Tough prenup, huh?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this, but,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; more hoots of laughter erupted from Mrs.
Richthofen&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;my husband drew up the agreement. They signed it right here in the
library. And I sort of sneaked a peek at it. I tell you, I thought I was going to going to
split a gut&nbsp;&#8211; oh, excuse my language.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s quite all right, Mrs. Richthofen&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;At the end there, I thought Erich would wise up and exercise his rights. Did you know
that little floozy was after the tail of some competitor of Erich&#8217;s? At least, that&#8217;s what
my husband let slip. And what does Erich do? Whisks her off to California, as if that
would solve the problem&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Any name for this competitor?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mmm. I couldn&#8217;t pry that out of Frederick&nbsp;&#8211; that&#8217;s my husband. I&#8217;ve just returned
from a three-month stay in Europe, so I haven&#8217;t caught up on all the local gossip.&#8221; She
laughed. &#8220;But I certainly have friends who are in the know. Would you like me to ask
around? Don&#8217;t worry. I shall be the soul&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; Mrs.Richthofen&#8217;s voice sang out the word&nbsp;&#8211;
&#8220;of discretion.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura doubted it, but she wasn&#8217;t trolling for such souls at the moment. &#8220;I&#8217;d appreciate
that, Mrs. Richthofen&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You ask me, Erich should&#8217;ve just stepped back and caught her <i>in flagrante</i>. Put that
prenup to good use. But, I suppose he&#8217;d view that as a defeat. And he&#8217;s not the type
to admit defeat. He&#8217;d rather try to control her behavior. Well, I think he&#8217;s in store for a
nasty surprise. I think he&#8217;d have to move her to an island staffed only by women and
eunuchs. Hmm. Maybe just eunuchs. Hmm, come to think of it, that probably wouldn&#8217;t
stop her either&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What did the prenup say?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Wellll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, what the hey.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura readied her pen to take down the details.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">After spending the rest of the afternoon at the library scanning microfiche of
newspapers for the Raeder name, Laura returned to the office in the early evening.
She checked her messages and returned a call to Ed Hines. Next, she paged through
her notes, looking for the insurance information on the ruby necklace. She checked
the date of purchase and nodded to herself. Finally, she went to rally the troops. She
found all of them already in Steele&#8217;s spacious office. Steele was to himself at his desk,
Murphy and Bernice were in the conference area. Battle lines drawn?</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The low table in front of the couch was littered with empty coffee cups and take-out
trays. Bernice offered her a chocolate brownie. Laura shot her a dirty look. Bernice
<i>knew</i> she shouldn&#8217;t have chocolate &#8211; like liquor to an alcoholic. Bernice shrugged,
gathered up the mess they&#8217;d made, and left the room.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura walked over to Steele&#8217;s desk and addressed the men. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hear what
you&#8217;ve got.&#8221; She could hardly keep from blurting out her findings, but decided to hold
off until last.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele leaned back in his chair and shook his head. &#8220;I regret to say I&#8217;ve come up with
nothing of much use to us about Raeder. There&#8217;s the interesting rumour his family&#8217;s
involvement in the Nazi plundering of artwork is partially responsible for his vast
wealth. But he&#8217;s not in debt to any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. intermediaries or in trouble with any of the
organized criminal elements that have turned their attention to the art world.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy walked over to the desk. &#8220;Well, <i>I&#8217;ve</i> got something interesting. Raeder has a
$4 million bank loan that the Chase Manhattan Bank has asked him to either pay off or
put up more collateral. The deadline&#8217;s fast approaching.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Good work, Murph!&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes, splendid, old boy&nbsp;&#8211; got you to the right source, did I?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">At Steele&#8217;s cocky look, Murphy glowered, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how ethical that was &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Nonsense. PI&#8217;s do it in the movies all the time&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura cut in before the ethics&nbsp;&#8211; or lack thereof&nbsp;&#8211; debate could continue. &#8220;Ms. Raeder is
a con artist.&#8221; She decorously refrained from grinning like an idiot at their dropped
jaws. Thank God for Murphy: Ed had proved invaluable, ferreting out some very
interesting information from a county clerk in NY and from an NYPD buddy in the
fraud detail who&#8217;d been relentless in his pursuit of the woman. &#8220;She&#8217;s a sweetheart
scammer. Before meeting Erich Raeder, she was married to a lovesick, ninety-two-year-old gentleman. She cashed in his $10,000 monthly stipends, ran all his credit
cards to the limit, depleted one $800,000 trust fund and was in the process of doing
the same with another when he died. Before that, it was a rich old eighty-five-year-old. There&#8217;s probably a whole string of them, according to a New York detective. And
all the while, she was carrying on with one rich playboy or another, men who could
care less about throwing their money away on her.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She leaned her hands on Steele&#8217;s desk. &#8220;Unfortunately, though, no one can prove she
committed a crime. Her &#8216;husbands&#8217; were men without family, who evidently thought
they were in love with her. They ignored their lawyers&#8217; advice that, at the least, she
was a &#8216;not-nice&#8217; person and they needed to protect their financial interests. They&#8217;d
say they saw no need, she&#8217;d always been good to them.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, my!&#8221; Whether Steele&#8217;s exclamation and grin of admiration were for the scammer&#8217;s
exploits or for her own uncovering of these facts, Laura was unsure. &#8220;But Erich Raeder
doesn&#8217;t fit the pattern,&#8221; Steele continued. &#8220;He&#8217;s not some doddering old pigeon.
What&#8217;s her game? A pity if she just fell in love and decided to change. No motive
there.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy sat on the edge of Steele&#8217;s desk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, <i>old boy</i>, people like that never
change. When con artists aren&#8217;t pulling a con, they study at the feet of their masters
or hone their techniques for luring in their next victim. They don&#8217;t &#8216;change.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele put a hand to his heart. &#8220;Murphy. I&#8217;m sore wounded. <i>Anyone</i> can change given
sufficient motivation.&#8221; He looked at Laura and gave a conspiratorial smile and wink.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy narrowed his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced. And she&#8217;s the worst kind of con
artist, the kind who uses sexual attractiveness to manipulate the victim.&#8221; He stared
hard at Steele, who merely raised an eyebrow in return.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura reached out and touched Murphy&#8217;s arm. Easy, friend.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She straightened. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get back on track. Apparently Ms. Raeder, or rather, as she
was known then, Loralei&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;How appropriate,&#8221; Steele interjected.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Loralei.&#8217; It&#8217;s a German name. It means &#8216;she whose singing lures men to destruction.&#8217;
There&#8217;s a famous German folksong, &#8216;Die Loralei,&#8217; whose words were written by the
exceptional German poet Heinrich Heine.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Where did he get this stuff? Laura sat on the front corner edge of the desk and looked
at Steele. &#8220;Yes, well, anyway, the story I&#8217;m getting from all quarters&nbsp;&#8211; you, the New
York paper gossip sections, Murphy&#8217;s friend Ed Hines, and a New York detective friend
of Ed&#8217;s&nbsp;&#8211; is that Loralei met Erich Raeder at a party in New York about a year ago. They
married just a few weeks later. There&#8217;s an odd clause in the prenuptial agreement: if
there&#8217;s an act of infidelity on her part, she&#8217;s to be cut off without a penny.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That must put a crimp in her style,&#8221; Steele observed.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy flicked his eyes at Steele. &#8220;Not so&#8217;s you&#8217;d notice, if that party the night of the
theft was any indication.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Steele cleared his throat and shifted in his chair.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura folded her arms. &#8220;According to the New York rumor mill, Ms. Raeder became
attracted to a business rival of her husband&#8217;s in New York, and that&#8217;s what sparked
their move out here. The ruby necklace was bought for her at the same time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She watched as Steele smiled, got up out of his chair, went to the front of his desk,
and leaned his hands on it. What was it about him? Why couldn&#8217;t she keep her eyes off
him whenever he was in the room? Everything about him was so distinctive&nbsp;&#8211; the way
he talked, the way he gestured, the way he moved. &#8216;&Eacute;lan,&#8217; Daniel had called it&nbsp;&#8211; the
street kid had picked up &eacute;lan. The pauper had become a prince.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele looked at Laura. &#8220;So the necklace was a bribe.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele tugged an earlobe. &#8220;It seems to me we now have many motives for one or the
other or both of the Raeders. It could be a scam on Loralei&#8217;s part&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;If she and this other guy were lovers, he may be blackmailing her&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele nodded at Murphy. &#8220;Yes, she&#8217;d lose every cent of Raeder&#8217;s if this were to come
out, and I&#8217;ll wager his wealth far surpasses anything she&#8217;s come across yet. A rival of
Raeder&#8217;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. .&#8221; Steele straightened up. &#8220;What better way to vanquish Raeder than to
cuckold him. Perhaps Raeder even knows his wife was unfaithful but doesn&#8217;t want to
open himself to public humiliation after all &#8211; he&#8217;d rather pay the blackmail. And what
better price for the blackmailer to demand than the symbol of her supposed
acquiescence, the ruby. Or, or, or,&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221; he emphasized each syllable with his hand&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;no
blackmail&nbsp;&#8211; Raeder arranged for the theft, humiliated by his wife&#8217;s betrayal and her
subsequent demand for the bauble in return for her public commitment to him. This
is his way of taking it back from her without appearing to do so.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;There&#8217;s still the insurance angle &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele clapped his hands together. &#8220;Oh-ho, yes! Glad to see you&#8217;re getting in the spirit
of things, Murphy.&#8221; He slapped Murphy on the shoulder.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy rolled his eyes. &#8220;Not so fast, Steele. There&#8217;s still a little matter of proof. The
evidence still points to you. We don&#8217;t even have a candidate for this
blackmailer/lover.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ah, Laura will smoke &#8217;im out, Murphy.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy shook his head and left the room. As Laura went into her office to collect her
things before leaving for the night, Murphy popped back into her office. &#8220;The Raeders
are worth investigating, but I&#8217;m still going to keep a very, very, close eye on this guy,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; he jerked his head toward Steele&#8217;s office&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m still going to investigate <i>his </i>possible
role in these thefts. I&#8217;m not going to let us be conned, Laura.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura patted Murphy&#8217;s arm and started to speak, but turned abruptly as the door to
her office opened and Steele came in.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh. Am I interrupting something?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No,&#8221; Laura told him. She turned back to Murphy. &#8220;Follow up on <i>all</i> your leads,
Murphy.&#8221; Murphy nodded, flicked a glance at Steele, and left the room.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele came to stand in front of her. &#8220;There&#8217;s a movie on at LACMA</span></span>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;We need a break,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;Nothing else can be done now. We should spend a
relaxing evening, start fresh in the morning.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221; It was several long moments before she realized she was just standing there
gazing into his eyes. What was this, had he been a damn hypnotist in his obscure
past? &#8216;Look into my eyes. Nothing else can be done now. You should spend a relaxing
evening. You will go to a movie with me. And afterwards, you will&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8217; She shook
herself. &#8220;I want to stake out the Raeders tonight. It&#8217;s been a long day, and I need to
take a short nap first.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh.&#8221; Steele&#8217;s face fell slightly, but then he brightened. &#8220;What if someone else does it
for you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Takes my nap?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">A chuckle escaped Steele. &#8220;The stakeout.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I want you with Murphy at Carl&#8217;s &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I have someone else in mind.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And just who might that be?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He grinned. &#8220;Officer McCarthy. Hollywood Community Police Station.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And just why would he do this for us?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He gave a little shrug. &#8220;I did him a favour.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Oh, no. Now what? Laura paced away from him and then turned back. &#8220;What kind of
favor?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;A small favour.&#8221; As her exasperation built, he lifted his hand and formed a half-inch
of space between thumb and index finger. &#8220;A very, very small favour.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">God help her, she was going to wring his neck. &#8220;A small enough favor that he&#8217;s going
to sit up all night for us at the Raeder mansion where probably nothing will happen.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes. At the very least.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura huffed out her exasperation, stalked toward him, and backed him up against the
desk. Would those fine, delicate cervical bones of his snap easily? She was mere
seconds from finding out. &#8220;Are you telling me you&#8217;ve got this guy in your pocket?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Evidently reading her murderous intentions, Steele leaned away from her. &#8220;Laura. It&#8217;s

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura tapped Steele&#8217;s chest. &#8220;If memory serves, you proved that charge bogus by

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Accidentally? Why, Laura, as you yourself said, I was just following my infallible

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mr. Steele, can we please get back to how Officer McCarthy fits into all this?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ah, yes. Well, as you recall, after we&#8217;d cleared her, she got a guest spot on 'The Love
Boat' to fall down a funnel and die&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I remember you waltzing in here in sunglasses, scarf, and camel hair coat, looking
like Cecil B. De Mille, carrying a script, spouting some line of guff about running lines
with her on the set.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes, well, I <i>did</i> manage to obtain that position with her&nbsp;&#8211; the production people
couldn&#8217;t refuse her anything with all the publicity she was generating, and she was, uh
&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You wheedled her into getting you onto the set.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele glared at her while she smirked. &#8220;She was open to the suggestion. Anyway,
Officer McCarthy was one of the people investigating the murder, and he&#8217;s a real 'Love
Boat' fan&nbsp;&#8211; there&#8217;s no accounting for some people&#8217;s taste&nbsp;&#8211; and he asked me if I could,
well, you know, if I could&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Let me guess. You got him onto the set. And then the two of you snuck around and
you got him introduced to Gavin MacLeod&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Fred Grandy, Bernie Kopell, Ted Lange, Lauren Tewes, Jill Whelan&nbsp;&#8211; McCarthy was in
heaven. And we did not sneak. I merely presented him as a special agent, there to see
to Miss Kirk&#8217;s safety&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;A <i>special agent</i>? You had him impersonating an <i>FBI </i>agent?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No, Laura, no. We never said he was FBI. I just had a little card printed up for him, all
official-looking. It said &#8216;Special Agent McCarthy.&#8217; It didn&#8217;t say who he was special to.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura could feel it building in her, more and more. She balled her fists, tried to hold it
back, but she couldn&#8217;t stop it. She threw back her head and started to laugh. After all
the horrible things she&#8217;d been imagining, this childish prank was a relief.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele grinned. &#8220;So, shall I call him?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She shrugged and smiled. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Splendid.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">After Steele arranged things with McCarthy, Laura called out to Murphy. &#8220;Hey, Murph,
you want to go to a movie with us tonight?&#8221; She ignored the lugubrious look on
Steele&#8217;s face.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going home to catch forty winks. <i>One</i> of us actually intends to go to and stay
awake through a stakeout tonight.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura hid her smile at Steele&#8217;s not-too-well-hidden look of relief. Of course, she&#8217;d
known Murphy wouldn&#8217;t come.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele extended his elbow. &#8220;Shall we, Miss Holt?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura took his arm and smiled up at him as they exited the suite. &#8220;We shall, Mr.

movie purely as some sort of expression of twisted humor: Humphrey Bogart&nbsp;&#8211; one of
Steele&#8217;s favorite actors&nbsp;&#8211; played a minor, forgettable role as &#8216;Michael O&#8217;Leary,&#8217;
forgettable except that &#8216;Michael O&#8217;Leary&#8217; was the name Steele had used when stealing
&#8216;The Five Nudes of Cairo.&#8217; The first time he&#8217;d stolen it, that is.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And the leading male character of the movie was named &#8216;Steele.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But something else was going on, something she couldn&#8217;t quite fathom. He was
absorbed in the movie, captured by it, oblivious to his surroundings, oblivious even to
her. His body twitched in empathetic reaction to the action on the screen.</span></span></p>

more movies with him. Maybe then she could&#8217;ve deciphered him better. She began
noting the lines and scenes where he&#8217;d clear his throat or shift around in his seat; she
also noted the lines where she did the same:</span></span></p>

encouragement?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but if he hasn't given you any signs, how do you know?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Well, that's it. I don't know. But he didn't go away. That's one sign. It must mean
something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp. before, women have never meant anything to me. I'd never met

Shoulder-to-shoulder. Cheek-to-cheek. Face-to-face.&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He pulled back. &#8220;Ah. No &#8216;sleeping with the enemy,&#8217; eh?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Was he her enemy?</span></span></p>

brush down and fingered the daisies in the vase in front of her. They were wilting.
Steele had picked them up on a whim the week before when he and Laura were at the
Grand Central Market and had presented them to her with a flourish. That had been the
first time she&#8217;d done anything with him so casual as shopping. He&#8217;d made it fun,
rubbing elbows with the Westside chefs, Valley socialites, Mexican housewives, and
the rest of L.A.&#8217;s polyglot population, searching with them for the ripest tomatillos and
the plumpest grapes, the smell of coffee beans and herbs and spices lingering in the
air, the old-fashioned neon signs above them proclaiming that things hadn&#8217;t changed
here much in the last sixty years. They&#8217;d wandered among the bustling crowd through
the European-style open stalls filled with produce, past display cases of meats and
seafood and cheeses. One vendor sold nothing but beans&nbsp;&#8211; there must&#8217;ve been at
least fifty varieties: reddish brown, glossy black, creamy white, pale green, buff, and
orange, and yellow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She&#8217;d been in awe of the enormous tortilla machine&nbsp;&#8211; dough was fed in one side and
out the other popped the finished tortillas. She&#8217;d been disappointed when he&#8217;d
insisted she not indulge herself in what was reputed to be the biggest burrito in town
nor sample a pastry, but she&#8217;d been glad she hadn&#8217;t when she&#8217;d dined on the repast
he&#8217;d put together from the fruits of their labor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She sighed and cast another glance at the daisies. Daisies, the symbol of loyal love
and innocence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Tender&nbsp;&#8211; his kisses were tender. That&#8217;s what she knew about him. He brought to her
life romance and sensuality, pleasures she&#8217;d denied herself in recent years in her
quest for professional success. What else did she know? He had compassion&nbsp;&#8211; not
worn on his sleeve, but revealed in case after case over the past year. Compassion for
&#8216;the little guy.&#8217; What else? He displayed a streak of opportunism. He had the expert
ability to breach buildings and people by exploiting their vulnerabilities&nbsp;&#8211; an ability
that could be used for either good or for ill, by the detective or by the con artist/thief.
An ability that could be used against her.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She stared hard into the mirror. An &#8216;All-American Girl,&#8217; not an &#8216;American Beauty,&#8217;
stared back: hers was not the glamorous face and figure of a Felicia, or a Lora Raeder,
or of one of the women seen on Steele&#8217;s arm his first few months here, as any
enquiring mind who perused the photos in the gossip section of the Trib could verify.
Funny, he hadn&#8217;t been linked by the tabloids to anyone in quite some time now &#8211; not
since their trip to Devil&#8217;s Island</span></span>

without knowing it wasn&#8217;t just for the moment, without a commitment of sorts. She&#8217;d
secretly hoped the two facts were connected, but she&#8217;d needed more evidence.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Besides, it didn&#8217;t really make any sense he&#8217;d be attracted to her&nbsp;&#8211; she was nothing like
those other women, either in looks, temperament, or brain power, of which they had
none. This was just more evidence he&#8217;d been priming her while waiting for an
opportunity like this to come along, so he could use her heart against her&nbsp;&#8211; No! He
was never more honest than when he was kissing her, she was sure of that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wasn&#8217;t
she?</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She angrily swiped at her eyes. If that sonovabitch had used her, he was going to pay
dearly for it. She shoved herself away from the dressing table and snatched at the
daisies to throw them in the trash. As she touched the stems, some of the petals fell
off. She froze.</span></span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She turned off the light and climbed into bed, leaving the wilted daisies in the vase on
the table, clutching her pillow to her stomach, wondering what was really going on
behind those eyes when he looked at her with such desire.</span></span></p>

&#8211; beautiful man lying asleep next to her in the bed. She smiled. Men had often told
her her smile was predatory. She padded over to the bureau naked and from her purse
took out lipstick, a compact, and a comb. They were a matching set, continental gilt
silver, decorated with enamel, set with cabochon carnelian stones; they dated from the
early 1900s. She combed out the tangles from her fine hair; then using the compact&#8217;s
mirror, she carefully applied the lipstick. She ran her tongue slowly over her lips. The
color of the lipstick pleased her. Red. Ruby red. Pigeon blood red.</span></span></p>

the single dim light coming from the mansion, coming from one of the rooms on the
upper floor. What the hell was Steele onto here? He looked again at his notes&nbsp;&#8211; he was
going to have to clean them up a bit before showing them to Steele or that babe, Holt:</span></span></p>
