<br>
<p>SUMMARY: Is Lord Claridge the father of Remington Steele after all?</p>
<br>
<p>Author&#8217;s notes:</p>
<br>
<p>1) Although the remaining approximately 24 pages are my own work, the direct dialogue on the
first approximately four pages is from two scenes in <span style="color: #0000ff">Steele Searching Part II, </span>the episode written
by Michael Gleason, which aired Oct 1, 1985 (to set the time period for my story). The full
transcription of the episode can be found on Nancy's site
<a href="http://rsepguide.topcities.com/season4.html"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">http://rsepguide.topcities.com/season4.html.</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000">  The direct dialogue from those two scenes is word-for-word from the aired episode, but I have inserted my own narration to go with it in order to
show, in particular, what is &#8220;really&#8221; going on (in terms of <i>my</i> story, I mean). Then I took it from
there.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2) The short companion piece (one page), Steele Beginning, appearing immediately after this
story, is meant to be read as an integral part of it. The second companion piece (three pages),
Steele Connector, rounds out the picture.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3) Feedback is welcomed and desired! E-mail:</span><a href="mailto:E-mail:drpeg2003@yahoo.com"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">drpeg2003@yahoo.com</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000"> . Group members, please
feel free to post directly to the list.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">4) Special thanks to Angie. Without her initial encouragement, I&#8217;m not sure I would have ever put
pen to paper.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">5) Thanks to my betas: Gary G., Jill Hargan, and Angie Nothdorf. Thanks also to Kathryn Marsh
for her answers to questions on British, Irish, and noble matters. And thanks to all the RS fanfic
authors, whose works have brought me such pleasure. I hope my stories will provide you with
some of that same pleasure.</span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><i>Dear God. Could he be my son?</i></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge stood at the far end of his study, awaiting Mr. Steele. He put his hand in his
pocket, fingering the watch, the watch Miss Holt had brought to him. Of this he was certain: he
would never forget his meeting with her just days ago. . . . </span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He had been in the gallery of his manor, admiring the portrait of Catherine, not yet his wife, when
he had heard the knock at the door. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As he crossed the room, Miss Holt entered. He held out his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She took it. &#8220;Your Lordship."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"How pleasant to see you again, Miss Holt."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"I was wondering if a . . . a friend of mine has been here. He's tall, rather good looking . . . with
dark hair . . . "</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge shook his head. "No. What would he want with me?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"He came to England to trace his past. It can best be described as murky. He did, however, have
one tangible link." She reached into her purse. "Someone sent it to him with the note 'Your father
wanted you to have this.' " She showed him the watch in her hand, giving a questioning shrug. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Oh my God," he whispered, turning and walking away a few paces. That watch. Missing for
thirty-odd years, ending up with a man tracing his past &#8211; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Um . . . the inscription is a little difficult to read." Miss Holt opened the watch and the Irish tune
filled the air.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Not facing her, he recited:&#8220; &#8216;To S.J. from K.L.&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"I know on occasion you've used the name &#8216;Kevin Landers.&#8217; "</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"This friend of yours. How old is he?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Early thirties."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The age was right.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Raised . . . where?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Ireland, for the most part."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A distinct possibility. He nodded his head. He had not moved from his spot.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She came to him, asking, "Do you know who he is?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Dear God. Had he <i>another</i> son out there? A longing arose in him. "Very likely. My son.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The music stopped.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">How soon must he face this? "Your friend. Where is he?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"I . . . I don't know. I'm trying to find him."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><i>Very likely. My son</i>. The words had escaped his lips before he could give thought to where they
might lead. Well, a lie woven from truths &#8211; the best kind of lie &#8211; would provide him with cover:
intending she believe it was Sean to whom his earlier words had referred, he finally turned toward
Miss Holt and spoke of the son for whom he <i>had</i> been searching."All these years . . . all these
wasted years . . . I was no more than a boy myself. There was a young Irish girl who worked on
the estate &#8211; terrible disgrace. She took the child back to Ireland, refused any help. Eventually,
disappeared. I only saw my son . . . once."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Another knock on the door. "Sorry to intrude, your Lordship, but there's a gentleman to see you.
Something about a presentation at the wedding reception?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was relieved by the interruption."Yes, yes, I'll be along in a minute.&#8221; He looked again at Miss
Holt. "May I have that?" he asked, indicating the watch. At her hesitation, he lifted up his palms in
entreaty. "For a, a little while."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Miss Holt gave him a slight smile."Of course."She placed it in his palm.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He had then left the gallery. He had needed time: time to absorb this new possibility, time to
decide what to do about a son who was . . . not Sean.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Once again, Lord Claridge ran his fingers over the watch; then he removed his hand from his
pocket and gently rubbed the new wedding band on his finger. He had been unable to make a final
decision. In mere moments he would be forced to do so. He had prepared his role as best he
could: he would continue with the story he had given Miss Holt, speaking to Mr. Steele as if he
were speaking to Sean.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As for claiming him &#8211; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He looked up as the door opened. Miss Holt and her friend, Remington Steele, entered. Mr.
Steele carefully closed the door and then looked at him, but he made no further move. Lord
Claridge studied the man for a long moment and then slowly crossed the room toward him. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Hello," Mr. Steele said softly, finally moving toward Lord Claridge.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge offered his hand and then an embrace &#8211;  a tentative gesture on both their parts, a
gesture of intimacy not yet felt. He began his deception: "You've no idea how many years I've
waited for this."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mr. Steele let out a long breath. "I . . . I think I do. . . .&#8221; There was a long pause, and then he
continued, his voice wistful. &#8220;Ever since . . . I was a child, I realized that I wasn't like other
children. Well, in the sense that . . . I had no parents, no real parents, no true home. . . . I was
always trying to imagine what my real father was like . . .  creating . . . recreating his image, you
know, how he, how he talked, how he walked . . ." &#8211; Mr. Steele smiled and gave a small laugh &#8211;
"how he smiled."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mr. Steele&#8217;s heartfelt manner, as well as his words, affected Lord Claridge deeply. It made it easy
to slip into his role. "I regret many things, but none more severely than losing you."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"There's time. . . . There's much time." </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Such sincerity. "Let me look at you. Firm jaw. Blue eyes." God. He had to look away. If only this
man didn&#8217;t look so much like her. But he clearly saw the resemblance &#8211; the coloring, the shape of
the nose and mouth. Those eyes. This was her son. And likely his bastard son, one who would
only be a constant reminder of &#8211; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Your Lordship?" Miss Holt, who had stayed back by the door, now came toward him, breaking
into his thoughts.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"What is it?" Mr. Steele asked.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He must distance himself from this man. To Mr. Steele he said, &#8220;Your eyes."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"What about them?" Miss Holt asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"They're blue."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Is that a problem?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He answered her but looked at Mr. Steele. "My son has . . . hazel eyes, like his mother."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Are you sure? You said you only saw him once."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mr. Steele raised his hand to stop further protests. "I . . . I don't think . . . a father could make
that mistake so easily. . . . Could he, your Lordship?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He heard the faint hope in Mr. Steele&#8217;s voice. He feared he had betrayed some sign of
recognition. He had been given one more chance to acknowledge the possibility Mr. Steele was
his son &#8211; but he could not. "No," he said with finality.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Are you saying he isn't your &#8211; but he's the right age, and he was raised in Ireland &#8211; and the
watch? What about the watch?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge returned smoothly to his story: he was practiced in the art of deception &#8211; it ran in
his genes. "Well, the initials &#8220;S.J.&#8221; stand for Sean James. The boy's name.&#8221; Actually, the boy&#8217;s
mother had only said she was calling the baby &#8220;Sean,&#8221; given him his first &#8211; and last &#8211; look at the
boy, and left. He now picked "James" to fit the initial. &#8220;I gave it to a friend to make sure he
received it when he came of age."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Well, there you are," Miss Holt said.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"However, the watch was lost or stolen. And when you turned up with it, I naturally assumed it
had found its way back to my son."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Well, that would make sense," Mr.Steele put in.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"<i>What</i> does?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"My father probably stole the watch," Mr. Steele told Miss Holt and then gave a slight, self-deprecative smile.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Playing his part, Lord Claridge smiled sadly in return. "I'm truly sorry, Mr. Steele. For both our
sakes." He offered his hand again. Mr. Steele took it, smiled sympathetically, and then clasped
him in an embrace meant to offer comfort.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mr. Steele turned to go. "Shall we, Miss Holt? I think we have a long way to go. Good day to
you, sir."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Miss Holt reached out and touched Mr. Steele&#8217;s arm. "I'm so sorry." </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mr. Steele looked back at him one last time, raising his hand, and Lord Claridge smiled quietly in
farewell. The smile left his face as the door closed behind them.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Fortunately, both Mr. Steele and Miss Holt had been so thrown off-balance by the whole affair
that they were taken in by his story. He took the watch from his pocket and let his thoughts drift
back to a time more than 30 years ago.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Shawna, the love of his life. She and her family were recent arrivals to London, she had said,
though she had never allowed him to meet her family. She was a pretty, Irish girl &#8211; tall, slim, with
long, dark hair and blue eyes. She had a small, cherished collection of pocket watches she brought
to show him one day. She said the first was from her beloved "grandda,&#8221; the second was from her
favorite "uncail,&#8221; and the last, a recent sixteenth birthday gift, was from her parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">They met secretly, for he was twenty years old and she said she didn't think her parents would
approve of the relationship. He felt that he was so much more worldly than she. He thought her
girlish, innocent, but he was filled with a passion that nearly overwhelmed him. His kisses had
grown increasingly urgent, he had tried to fondle her, but she always pushed him away. Lately, he
had been growing angry at her refusals. He tried to keep it in check, but it was hard. To make
amends, to win her over, he bought her a gold pocket watch that played "When Irish Eyes Are
Smiling&#8221; and had it engraved. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He went to meet her.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Shawna,&#8221; he whispered, gathering her in his arms. He loved speaking her name, always using it
more than one should. The kiss was gentle, sweet. He pulled away slightly, reaching into his
pocket. "I have something for you." He took out the watch, placed it in her palm, and closed her
fingers over it.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Ohhh . . . it's lovely." She opened it, smiling as the tune played. She read the inscription aloud,
"To S.J. from K.L.." Puzzled, she looked at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">" &#8216;S.J.&#8217; &#8211; you know &#8211; &#8216;Shawna Jones.&#8217;" He grinned broadly, knowing the effect it would have on
her.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She laughed with delight. "That part I be knowin', your Lordship,&#8221; she teased, "But K.L.?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Kevin Landers. A name I use sometimes." He was fond of calling himself by different names as
the need arose. "This way, should you ever be careless and your parents come across it, they
won't be able to trace it back to me."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Although she still seemed a little taken aback by the false name, she gave him a small smile.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As he looked at her, desire again suddenly overwhelmed him. He pulled her into his arms, kissed
her, softly at first, but then the restraint he had resolved to exhibit vanished, and he kissed her
deeply, his hands roaming her body, pushing at her skirts. Dropping the watch, she sought to
break away. He wouldn't let her. She struggled against him, refusing to yield. Angered, he raised
his hand to strike her but stopped, shoving her from him. She fell to her hands and knees,
scrambled away, made her way to her feet, and began to run. He stood there, panting. "Irish
bitch," he hissed under his breath. He stooped, picking up the watch.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He found himself in a dingy pub in an unfamiliar part of the inner city, putting away pint after pint.
He was in a poor, ethnically diverse area, and the patronage reflected that. Her voice drew his
attention first: it was Irish, an accent so strong he could barely make out a word. She was <i>very</i>
young, tall, and thin almost to the point of malnourishment. . . . A whore . . . Fury rose in him as
he thought of Shawna. He approached her, gave her money, led her out into the streets, and found
an alley. In the dim light, for the first time, he looked closely at her face. He blinked in surprise:
had she been able to take care of herself, she could have been beautiful. Her skin, though
unnaturally pale, was flawless. Her black hair, with lovely brown undertones, could have been
luxuriant. He memorized the shape of her mouth, her nose. He allowed himself to be drawn,
momentarily, into those blue eyes. He wanted to remember his &#8220;first.&#8221; He took her, gently to
start; then he became rough. He clamped his hand over her mouth, stifling her cries. Then he hit
her. And he hit her again. And again. Finally he came out of the alley, straightening his clothes,
and made his way home. Then he realized the watch was missing.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Soon after, he was attracted to an Irish girl who worked on the estate. Unlike Shawna, she didn&#8217;t
refuse him. He wasn&#8217;t passionately in love with her, as he had been with Shawna, but the baby, <i>his</i>
baby, Sean, had captured his heart.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The occasional rages he still felt toward Shawna he took out during forays into various parts of
the inner city. As time went on, it became less and less about Shawna. It was just rage. It had
drastically escalated five years ago and had gotten way out of control. Also, he had made the
mistake of returning, again and again, to the same area, Whitechapel. The authorities could not
look the other way. They dealt with it discreetly, however, insisting that he leave for his family&#8217;s
holdings in Canada. His saving grace had been falling in love there, with Catherine, now his wife.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#160;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge looked down at the watch in his hand, opened its cover, listened to the tune, and
then closed it with a decisive snap and left his study.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He was being chased. Four older, heftier boys were in close pursuit. He passed a pub just as a
man and a woman were unlocking it. He heard the woman cry "Paddy, it's he!" The boys quickly
caught up to him and began pummeling him mercilessly. He raised his arms to ward off the blows:
he was an expert at the move. For some reason the barkeep waded in to help him, pulling the boys
off him. He caught a glimpse of the woman standing nearby, terrified. For a brief moment he
ceased his struggles. She seemed . . . familiar. But then he went into a frenzy as he heard a
copper's whistle and the call "What seems to be the trouble, Mr. O'Rourke?" He wriggled free and
took off.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Remington sat up with a start, bathed in sweat. He settled back onto the sheets, letting his
heartbeat slow as he realized it was just a dream. He reached his hands out to the sides, caressing
the Italian-made cotton sheets, reassuring himself of his present reality. He gave a small, rueful
laugh. "Ahh, the creativity of the human mind." They had just returned from London and their
encounter with the Earl of Claridge. He had managed to weave Patrick O'Rourke, the sender of
the watch, into a not atypical scene of his boyhood. He gave a small smile as he got up to wash
off and to change his silk pyjamas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge stared at the canopy overhead and shifted uncomfortably in his bed. He was dying.
He had never found Sean, the boy who meant so much to him. A few months ago, when he
learned he had not much longer to live, he told Catherine of Sean, of his indiscretion with the girl
who had worked on the estate, and of his intense desire to find Sean before he died. Until now,
however, he had closed his heart to his other son, known as Remington Steele. He had spent years
thinking of Sean, longing for him; he had felt no connection to Steele. Why would he want to
acknowledge a boy who had been conceived in hate and rage and was a crushing reminder of all
the cruelty he had inflicted then, and later? He wished that watch had never reappeared in his life a
year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And yet . . . he could have a son &#8211; a flesh-and-blood son &#8211; if he would but acknowledge him.
More important, he realized, he could give Steele his father, ending his search &#8211; he knew the pain
of such a search. Perhaps by finally putting Steele&#8217;s needs above his own selfish ones, he could
atone, to some small degree, for all the suffering he had caused in his life.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"There's time. There's much time," Steele had said. But there wasn't. Finally, Lord Claridge
decided to &#8211; <i>needed to </i>&#8211; reach out to this boy. . . . Man.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And he knew just the man who might serve as a bridge between him and this son. Daniel
Chalmers, along with Remington Steele, had saved his life at his wedding to Catherine. He had
offered Mr. Chalmers the position of Chief of Security for his estate at that time, and Mr.
Chalmers had accepted on a provisionary basis. He had become aware of Mr. Chalmers&#8217; close
relationship with Mr. Steele. Lord Claridge hoped to make use of it now. With that in mind, he
called his dear wife, Catherine, and Mr. Chalmers to his bedside.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He spoke without a preamble. "Catherine, Mr. Chalmers. I believe Remington Steele is my son. I
would like you, Mr. Chalmers, to contact him. Tell him I have news of his father and want to
speak to him personally about it. Stress to him the urgency &#8211; I have not long to live &#8211; but reveal
no more. I wish to do that myself. And if he will allow it, I will acknowledge him publicly and
leave him &#8211; and Sean, if he is found &#8211; land and property."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel's eyes lit up.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Catherine, however, was stunned and upset. &#8220; I don&#8217;t understand! How can Remington Steele be
your son? Who is <i>his</i> mother?&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge hesitated.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"I think I have a right to know.&#8221; Her tone was gentle but firm. She took his hand in hers.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;His mother . . . I don&#8217;t know her name. She was a prostitute . . . She must have picked my
pocket the night I &#8211; " he didn't finish that thought. "She must have taken my watch . . . a watch
that Mr. Steele traced to me. That was when I became aware of his existence. He is the very
image of her. Of that I am not mistaken."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Catherine bowed her head. She then got up and left the room without looking back. Lord
Claridge looked after her with deep regret.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel, however, was delighted. After all Daniel's scheming, Harry was truly related to royalty
and would be set for life! If only they had found this out earlier, so would he have been. But with
his heart condition, he, too, would not be around for long. He would not reap the benefits. How
disappointing. Daniel was sure Harry could live with the knowledge that his mother was a
prostitute, particularly given that his father was an earl! Despite Harry's tall tales that he
descended from Irish Kings and British generals, Daniel knew Harry expected his parents to be of
the humblest of beginnings at best.&#8220;Your Lordship,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge turned toward him.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I would be pleased to contact him for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lord Claridge spoke again. &#8220;Please, Mr. Chalmers, tell me about . . . my son, how you met.&#8221; He
settled back onto his pillows.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel looked at Lord Claridge, reading the same wistfulness in his eyes he had heard in his voice.
The precise truth wouldn&#8217;t do. Lord Claridge might take exception to Harry&#8217;s <i>colorful</i> past, and
Daniel couldn&#8217;t chance that. Harry&#8217;s future was at stake!</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I was in Brixton on some matters of . . . security, when I bumped into this young lad. He was
hustling on the streets,&#8221; &#8211; a bit of truth to make it believable &#8211; &#8220;and I could see he had talents that
could be used in much better ways. I persuaded him to try his luck with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The truth was far more complicated. Daniel let his tongue do the talking to Lord Claridge while
his mind was engaged with his recollections of his first encounter with Harry and of where that
had led. . . . </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He had been in Brixton for his <i>own</i> security, after one of his schemes had had some unfortunate
results, and the boy had literally bumped into <i>him</i>, expertly picking his pocket. Daniel had been in
immediate need of a partner<i> </i>with the talent to get him out his predicament. Unaware Daniel
himself was a cannon</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> and had quickly recognized his loss, the boy was overconfident. Daniel
easily followed him to an alley, where he was attempting to secrete his &#8220;earnings&#8221; behind a loose
brick. Daniel had the element of surprise and greater strength: he spun the boy around and pinned
him to the wall. Even so, if Daniel hadn&#8217;t been waving a fistful of money, taken from his
moneybelt, in the boy&#8217;s face, the lad would have no doubt wrested himself free.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Easy, easy. I need a light-fingered lad like you for a bit of help, my boy. I&#8217;ll pay you <i>this</i>&#8221; &#8211; he
waved the money under the boy&#8217;s nose again &#8211; &#8220;and an equal amount upon completion of the
job.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The boy&#8217;s eyes widened as he looked at the money, and he licked his lip. Then his eyes narrowed.
&#8220;What do I have t&#8217;do?&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel couldn&#8217;t quite place the accent &#8211; plenty of South London in there, to be sure, with the
dropped &#8220;h&#8221; and the blunted final &#8220;t,&#8221; but also an underlying current of something else. &#8220;Oh
nothing too complicated, if you think a slight lad like you can pass yourself off as a &#8216;toughie.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The boy bristled. &#8220;I can fucking do it.&#8221; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel released him. &#8220;Good lad.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The boy licked his lower lip again, put his hands in his pockets, and cocked an eyebrow at Daniel.
&#8220;I need t&#8217; get a few things. I&#8217;ll take half the rest&#8221; &#8211; referring to the final payment &#8211; &#8220;now. After
all, <i>mister</i>, if you&#8217;re desperate enough t&#8217;be asking for me help, chance is ya won&#8217;t be around for
me t&#8217; collect, will ya?&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel had caught the appraising look. Cheeky lad &#8211; he had to give him that. Amused, he agreed.
He gave the boy his instructions and the money. The boy stuffed the money in his pocket, gave
Daniel a grin and a wink, and took off. Daniel wasn&#8217;t at all sure his trust was well-placed. The lad,
however, more than rose to the occasion. He showed up in heavy bovver boots, turned-up jeans,
a knee-length overcoat, called himself &#8220;Kevin Saxby,</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> &#8221; and played his part to perfection. The plan
went off without a hitch.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">After that, Daniel used the boy off and on for other &#8220;jobs.&#8221; Each time, the boy insisted on using a
different name and immersed himself in a different character, but he was limited to those
suggested by his impoverished background. Daniel was both amused and impressed, though the
boy&#8217;s cockiness caused them more than one close call. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Still, all those names. Even when not on a &#8220;job,&#8221; the boy never seemed to use the same name
twice. In exasperation Daniel told the boy he couldn&#8217;t keep up with the &#8220;nom du jour&#8221; and to
please just pick one for Daniel to call him when they weren&#8217;t on &#8220;business.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Mmmm . . . &#8216;Harry,&#8217; &#8221; the boy told him, as usual dropping the &#8216;h.&#8217; &#8220;Did ya know Humphrey
Bogart played four different &#8216; Harry&#8217;s&#8217;, five &#8216;Joe&#8217;s&#8217; and a &#8216;Joseph&#8217;, and four &#8216;John&#8217;s&#8217;? I save
&#8216;John&#8217; for certain occasions, and I don&#8217;t want t&#8217; be a fucking &#8216;Joe&#8217;.&#8221; He seemed disturbed but
didn&#8217;t elaborate.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">To know the boy, even in passing, and that seemed to be the only way to know him, was to know
of his passion for films: it seemed as if he worked at least one into practically every verbal
exchange. Bogart was his favorite actor.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220; &#8216;Harry&#8217; it is, then.&#8221; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Over time, observing the boy&#8217;s malleability, creativity, and lightening-quick ability to improvise
and considering the success of their undertakings thus far, Daniel devised an audacious plan. He
would turn this boy into a gentleman, teaching him all he knew. The two of them would conquer
England. The Continent. The possibilities were endless.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Harry turned him down with a flat &#8220;no fucking thanks.&#8221; So until nearly a year later, they
continued with their usual arrangement. Daniel went down to meet Harry. The lad had just lifted
another wallet. Turning, he saw Daniel, grinned widely, pushed his cap back, and stepped off the
kerb to make his way across the heavily-trafficked street toward him.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Suddenly, Daniel heard the shout &#8220;There&#8217;s the mick</span>

<span style="color: #000000">!&#8221; He saw two older boys run toward Harry,
who took off like a shot. By the time Daniel made it across the street, they were out of sight.
Daniel half-ran in the direction the lads had gone. He was afraid he had lost them but then saw the
older boys exit an alley. They were dividing up and pocketing Harry&#8217;s take, laughing and
punching each other in the arm. When they were clear, Daniel ran into the alley. Harry lay there,
face-down, unmoving. Kneeling, Daniel gently turned him over. Blood was coming from his nose
and lip; bruises were already forming on his face. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Harry,&#8221; Daniel called softly, absently sliding his hands down the boy&#8217;s torso. Feeling wetness, he
lifted the boy&#8217;s shirt. Harry had been knifed. Frantic, Daniel ran out to the street, hailed a cab,
threw large bills at the driver, yelled at him to wait, returned to the alley, scooped the lad up, and
took him to the closest Casualty</span>

however, Harry agreed to a trial period of &#8220;being Eliza Doolittle,&#8221; as he put it, this time affecting
Rex Harrison&#8217;s accent and immediately supplying the annotation in perfect imitation thereof: &#8220;My
Fair Lady. Rex Harrison, Audrey Hepburn. Warner Brothers. 1964.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I saw to it he was given a well-rounded education,&#8221; Daniel told Lord Claridge. Perhaps not in
the traditional sense, but well-rounded, none-the-less.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Educating Harry had been a challenge from the start. The boy could barely read or write.
Intelligent and a quick study, he was also quick-tempered and sometimes reacted violently when
frustrated with his studies or otherwise. Not so surprising, given his background, but hard to take,
nonetheless. More than once, Daniel found books and drawings defaced or destroyed. On one
occasion the boy actually took his knife to the clothes Daniel had bought for him, ripping them to
shreds, and then disappeared.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Even with the help of an ingratiating character named &#8220;Chalkie,&#8221; it took Daniel a full two weeks

<span style="color: #000000">, the sounds of a film lulling him to sleep.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel gently shook him awake. Harry looked at him, eyes wide with fright.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Harry, would you be interested in starting horseback riding lessons tomorrow? A gentleman
must learn to play polo.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Harry&#8217;s look changed to one of disbelief followed by bafflement. He got up and followed Daniel
back to his flat without a word. After that, from time-to-time, when, evidently, the pressures of
becoming a gentleman or the need to not get too attached to anything or anyone had grown too
great, Harry might still unexpectedly disappear for a few days, but he always returned. His violent
outbursts became less frequent as time went on.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Thank God. Daniel wasn&#8217;t sure himself why he put up with the boy those first few months &#8211; the
hostility, anger, aloofness, arrogance. The disappearances. But rare, unguarded moments, like the
time Harry caught sight of a father and son walking together, the father&#8217;s hand on his boy&#8217;s
shoulder, touched him. Harry made no secret of his anger toward his <i>own</i> father, saying he didn&#8217;t
know who he was and graphically describing just what, exactly, he would do to the cunt if he ever
found out; so Daniel was totally taken by surprise when Harry just stood watching, completely
still, looking so wistful, so sad. When Daniel touched his arm, however, the boy angrily shook him
off, said he had &#8220;business,&#8221; and once again disappeared for days, leaving Daniel feeling a curious
mix of exasperation and pity.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">There was also the quick wit, the charm he could turn on. And after that first crisis had passed,
there was the boy&#8217;s refusal to give up, his determination to bash on until he got it right, even
though his hotheadedness might still temporarily derail him. There was that wide grin of delight
when he did get it right. And he<i> got </i>it right, more and more. Daniel&#8217;s initial intuition about him
was proving to be correct: the lad would be a great asset to Daniel&#8217;s schemes. Moreover, Daniel
had to admit, he found an unexpected pleasure in teaching Harry. For the first time, Daniel found
himself caring about someone other than himself. Turning this lump of coal into a diamond gave a
deeper meaning to his admittedly hedonistic life than he had ever known.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;He excelled in English and art,&#8221; Daniel told Lord Claridge. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Irish. That was what he had been detecting in the boy&#8217;s accent. Daniel had had a devil of a time
toning down Harry&#8217;s Brixton-Irish bastardization of the Queen&#8217;s English and eliminating the
obscenities  &#8211; not to mention his . . . <i>colorful</i> . . .  Irish slang. Daniel inwardly winced, recalling
the first time he brought Harry to his flat. Upon asking him if he were hungry, the lad had replied,
&#8220;I could eat a babby's arse tru the bars of a cot.&#8221; Harry still never used two words when ten would
do, but other than that, there was little resemblance between the way he spoke then and the way
he spoke now.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Art, much to Daniel&#8217;s surprise, had turned out to be key to Harry&#8217;s metamorphosis. One time
when Harry began to act up, Daniel, on impulse, shoved a drawing pad and pencil into his hands
with the command &#8220;Draw!&#8221; Harry glared at him and then, as if in defiance, began to sketch
furiously. Daniel left the room while Harry filled sheet after sheet with graphic, violent images,
splashing his feelings onto the paper with vehemence. When Daniel reappeared over an hour later,
Harry was still drawing, but calmly. Harry had his back turned to Daniel, and his work so
absorbed him he didn&#8217;t even notice him. And he was talking to himself, telling a story about what
he was drawing. After that, Daniel frequently encouraged Harry to draw: he found it helped the
boy to control his impulses, to channel his frustration and anger without hurting anyone or
anything and without fearing reprisal. Harry hadn&#8217;t let him look at most of his drawings, and, after
accidently getting a look at some, he hadn&#8217;t wanted to. Many of the ones that were true-to-life
depicted scenes to which no one, certainly not a fourteen-year-old, should have been exposed.
The ones he did share with Daniel, however, showed that he had a real talent, and Daniel arranged
for him to have lessons. It had been a natural way for Harry to develop an interest in other
ventures close to Daniel&#8217;s heart. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;In fact, he developed a passion for fine art, precious artifacts, and gems. He&#8217;s an expert
gemnologist.&#8221; Daniel smiled with pride. Daniel had also refined Harry&#8217;s lock-picking and
pickpocketing techniques and had taught him how to open safes &#8211; a skill in which he soon
outshone his teacher &#8211; to better enable him to pursue those passions.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;His physical education wasn&#8217;t neglected, either.&#8221; That was much easier. Harry turned out to be
naturally gifted in that area. What took some work was his posture, learning to carry himself like a
man of breeding. Now, a proudly erect carriage was one of his trademarks. But so was putting his
hands in his pockets. Daniel had never been able to break Harry of the habit.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I saw to it that he had lessons in fencing, polo, tennis. He loves game shooting and fox hunts.&#8221;
Daniel wasn&#8217;t sure of the latter but threw it in anyway &#8211; that&#8217;s what a lord of the manor did, after
all; Harry could always improvise.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;We took the gentleman&#8217;s tour of the Continent, during which I taught him about fine wines, fine
cuisine &#8211; he&#8217;s now an excellent gourmet cook, himself &#8211; and introduced him to the mysteries of
the fairer sex. He&#8217;s skilled in dancing and in charming the ladies.&#8221; Though not as strikingly
handsome as he became as an adult, the transformed Harry had still turned heads. Daniel had
feared it would be a great struggle to teach an oik</span>

<span style="color: #000000">, in the throes of adolescence, how to be a
gentleman when surrounded by a bevy of admiring young (and not-so-young, for that matter)
females. Harry, however, proved surprisingly shy among the ladies and accepted Daniel&#8217;s
guidance in that area eagerly. He took to these lessons with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;He also does rather well at the gaming tables.&#8221; Especially when the two of them rigged the
game.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;After a few years, Harry &#8211; sorry &#8211; Remington &#8211;  struck out on his own. He is well-traveled and
has sampled a variety of occupations&#8221; &#8211; smuggler, boxer, gold prospector, art thief, jewel thief,
and heaven knew what else &#8211; &#8220;in his desire to broaden his horizons. We&#8217;ve kept in touch as best
we can; our paths cross occasionally. Currently, he is a &#8216;private detective&#8217;, as you know. An
extremely highly regarded one, I should add.&#8221; Might as well play that up. It could only elevate
Harry in Lord Claridge&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel glanced over at Lord Claridge. With a small smile playing upon his lips, the Earl of
Claridge had fallen asleep. Daniel sighed with relief: no need to dance around any pesky details
Lord Claridge might wish to know. He went out and set about making his plans.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">If he played his cards right, he would see Harry not only invested with the authority suitable to a
member of the peerage, but also divested of the authority of Linda. He knew full well her name
was &#8220;Laura.&#8221; By calling her &#8220;Linda,&#8221; however, he denied her any legitimacy in Harry&#8217;s life, just as
he rejected the legitimacy of his former protege&#8217;s present role, calling him &#8220;Harry&#8221; despite his
declaration to Daniel &#8220;the name is Steele, Remington Steele.&#8221; Hell, even Linda didn&#8217;t grant him
the legitimacy of <i>that</i> name.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Harry, he was sure, would come to see the advantages afforded to him as son of the Earl of
Claridge &#8211; wealth, glamor, easy living, having the pick of women ( and why restrict oneself to just
one?) &#8211; far outweighed anything life, or Linda, could offer him as Remington Steele.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel had difficulty, however, putting his plan in motion. That secretary &#8211; what was her name?
Melba? &#8211; said something about Mexico, about not disturbing them. She wasn't too forthcoming
with information. Then, certain matters involving his scheme with Marissa Peters, already set in
motion, intervened and could not be put off. Now, all hell threatened to break out concerning
Lord Claridge. At first, Daniel just saw rumors concerning his hasty departure to Canada six years
ago surface in the tabloids &#8211; they had focused on Lord Claridge due to his imminent death. Then,
somehow, one of the papers, perhaps with a contact in Scotland Yard, unearthed the real reason
for the arrangement of that departure, his beatings of prostitutes during drunken rampages in
Whitechapel. Soon after, rumors of such beatings over a more than thirty-year period circulated.
They were unsubstantiated, but Lord Claridge had been shattered: he had lapsed into a coma and
died within a few days.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This turn of events troubled Daniel. He just couldn't tell Harry now, not the way the press was
digging for dirt. He could just see <i>those </i>headlines. The great detective Remington Steele, bastard
son of the Earl of Claridge. Son of a whore. Son of the whore-beating Earl of Claridge.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Not that it would be all bad. Surely it would be just the thing to get him out of the clutches of
Linda. He would give up his &#8220;Remington Steele&#8221; persona, returning to that noblest of professions,
professional confidence man, supplementing his income with whatever Lord Claridge left him.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The problem was, Harry would no doubt have his face splashed all over the tabloids, and not just
in the British Isles. It might spread from there to Europe. After all, Harry had become known
there &#8211; especially to the police &#8211; after that Hapsburg Dagger affair. And Los Angeles papers
would naturally carry the story, Los Angeles being the home-base for Remington Steele
Investigations. With the public's thirst for sensationalism, who knew how far the news would
travel and how many papers would carry his photo. Harry was very photogenic. That sort of thing
was rather a threat to the anonymity required by a confidence man.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">No, this would close that road to him as well. And the peerage would never accept him under
these conditions. He would be left with nothing, not even Daniel himself. Daniel sighed. No, he
wouldn't tell Harry he was the son of Lord Claridge.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In fact, he had a better idea. He, Daniel, would be Harry's father. He would tell a story of a
woman who had loved him. Daniel concocted his story:</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Instead of seizing the moment, he had tried to pull off a caper &#8211;  and had ended up in prison.
While there, he found out that the woman had been pregnant with his child and had died giving
birth to it, and that the baby had been put up for adoption. After serving his time, he had no idea
where the baby was. He searched, but it wasn&#8217;t until that day in Brixton that he finally found the
boy. By then, the boy had built up so much hatred against his father that Daniel thought it better
to be his mentor than to identify himself as that father.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Telling Harry <i>this</i> story would surely be better than telling him he was the son of a prostitute and
the Earl of Claridge, a man whose past seemed to be filled with atrocities. Yes, Daniel liked this
story better and better. Harry would have his parents. It would be his final gift to Harry.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel went to tell Lady Claridge that he was not going to inform Harry &#8211; Mr. Steele &#8211; of his
possible relationship to Lord Claridge &#8211; after all, that hadn&#8217;t been his obligation; that, in fact, he
felt it best his former protege end his search for his father, a search that, if the truth were
uncovered, could only lead to unhappiness for all concerned, especially for Mr. Steele; and that, in
fact, he had just the way to see that search was ended. With consummate skill he persuaded her to
his thinking.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Then Daniel learned that Lord Claridge had, in any event, willed Ashford Castle in Ireland to
Steele; that Mr. Smithers, solicitor for the Earl of Claridge, had found Mr. Steele in London, on a
case, and had turned the castle over to him with the words Lord Claridge had instructed him to
say:&#8220;He always had a real bond with you, Mr. Steele. In a certain sense, you were that long-lost
son. Which is why he remembered you in his will &#8221;</span>

</script>
<span style="color: #000000">; and that Harry was on his way to the castle
now. Daniel left for the castle.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Unfortunately, Marissa Peters found out he was on his way to the castle and waylaid him there.
Though Daniel would rather have concentrated on his task with Harry, he felt he had no choice
but to continue with the deal he had made with her as well. He also discovered Harry had married
Linda. He couldn&#8217;t say that fact pleased him. Too bad he wasn&#8217;t going to be around much longer
to continue vying with her for Harry.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Finally, the time came when Daniel &#8220;admitted&#8221; to Harry he was his father. He<i> almost </i>didn&#8217;t go
through with it. But then &#8211; it was best for Harry.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Catherine sat in the large and lonely mansion and watched the televised military funeral for Daniel
Chalmers. It was hard to believe he was dead: just a few days ago he had been so full of vigor and
spirit as he induced her to go along with his deception of Mr. Steele. But that deception, no
matter how well-intentioned, had begun to trouble her more and more. Of course she had been
upset by her husband&#8217;s revelation, but Mr. Steele had the right to know the truth . . . didn't he?
Her husband's last wish had been to reveal his connection to him. Surely she was obligated to
honor that?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel's death removed any last hesitancy she felt about approaching the Steeles. But she would
be discreet: she had no wish to harm anyone else's reputation. She called the castle after the
broadcast. The line was busy. She tried a couple of times soon after, but the line just rang, and
rang, and rang. She would try again in the morning.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Hello?" Laura answered the ringing phone.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Mrs. Steele? This is Lady Claridge &#8211; Catherine. I have some . . . rather important news that
concerns your husband."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"He's not available right now. We're preparing to leave for London." Laura didn't want to mention
that the purpose of that visit was to legally turn the castle, left to Mr. Steele by Lord Claridge,
over to the servants. Last night had been magical: they&#8217;d always have the memory of that blissful
first union of their bodies as they gave themselves to each other completely. But other memories
conjured up the castle &#8211; servants handing them bills that hadn&#8217;t been paid in fifty-nine years and . .
.  Daniel&#8217;s death here &#8211; caused this place to lose its charm for them. They were ready to leave.
"May I ask what this is about?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"It's about . . . my late husband . . . and his relationship to <i>your</i> husband."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"His relationship?" Laura was immediately on the alert, eyebrows lifting.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"My husband was certain he was . . . Mr. Steele's father.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura sat down abruptly. "You have proof?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Perhaps it would be best to meet when you're in London. Then I'll explain as much as I can, all I
know."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura paused, considering. "All right. I'll contact you once we're in London."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"Mrs. Steele, please be discreet. I'm afraid the tabloids here have been digging up my husband's
past. Mr. Steele would suffer public humiliation, I fear, if the connection between him and my
husband were to become known at this point in time. I'll explain more fully when we meet."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura didn't understand but wasn't about to risk the public humiliation of Remington Steele. "All
right" was all she said. She hung up the phone. She saw no reason to tell Mr. Steele &#8211; she
couldn&#8217;t help it, she just couldn&#8217;t wrap her mind around calling him &#8220;Remington,&#8221; or anything
other than &#8220;Mr. Steele,&#8221; for that matter &#8211; about Lady Claridge's call. First, she would listen to
what Lady Claridge had to say, getting all the facts she could. Then, if those facts justified it, she
would tell him herself. She sighed. He had been deceived. Not only by Lord Claridge, but also by
Daniel, who he now thought was his father for god's sake. The lousy conman. If he were alive,
she would have killed him. She sighed again. When it came to life with Mr. Steele, was anything
ever going to be easy? She shook herself, got up, and continued preparing to leave for London.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Lady Claridge was right: the tabloids certainly had been busy. Lurid headlines leapt out at her
from the newsstands Laura walked by, as she made her way to her meeting with Lady Claridge.
She stopped, read the related article in one of the reputable papers, and gasped. The authorities
acknowledged they had substantiated that the Earl of Claridge had been the perpetrator not only
of &#8220;the Whitechapel beatings&#8221; six years ago, but also of similar beatings throughout the London
area over a more than thirty-year period prior to that. Lady Claridge must be devastated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">At their meeting Lady Claridge looked strained but remained remarkably composed. She told her
story about the watch, about Lord Claridge's insistence of the likeness between the prostitute and
Mr. Steele, about Daniel&#8217;s scheme, and about certain legal matters of inheritance. She answered
Laura's questions as best she could. She told Laura that, upon her husband's death, she had some
of his blood drawn for the purpose of paternity testing. It was under refrigeration, and if Mr.
Steele agreed to it, the testing could easily be done.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura felt the pieces fit well enough so that they should be presented to Mr. Steele. And paternity
testing would give objective results. You couldn't argue with objective results. Laura rose,
thanking Lady Claridge. She didn&#8217;t return immediately to the flat they had rented. Mr. Steele
wouldn&#8217;t be back from his meeting yet anyway, and she needed the time to consider just what she
would say to him. She also wanted to go to the lab where Lord Claridge&#8217;s blood was being kept,
so that she could find out about this relatively new procedure and, especially, about its accuracy.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Just as Laura&#8217;s meeting was getting underway, Remington opened a sleepy eye to check the
clock. &#8220;Oh no . . . ,&#8221; he moaned. He had overslept. He was exhausted from the night train trip
back from Ireland, from recent events, from . . . Daniel's death. He hadn&#8217;t even had time to absorb
that, really. He smiled sadly as he recalled how, immediately after Daniel&#8217;s death, he had taken up
where Daniel had left off in his scheme involving Marissa Peters. His expansion upon Daniel&#8217;s
original plan had led, ironically, to the burial of Daniel as a military hero. In two places. The
ultimate con. He deserved no less.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He sighed and then made to get out of the bed. Laura had already left; he couldn't quite remember
where she had gone off to. He got ready as quickly as his penchant for immaculate grooming
would allow.<span style="color: #ff0000"> </span>He took a less leisurely than usual shower, toweled off, shaved, brushed his teeth,
styled his hair, slipped into his dressing gown of finest Chinese silk, and made his way to the
kitchen. The larder and refrigerator were stocked to his specifications. Ingredients were organic
whenever possible. He set about making one of his favorite breakfasts. He carefully brewed a pot
of English Breakfast Tea</span>

<span style="color: #000000">. He allowed himself a small pat of exquisite deep yellow Jersey butter
with which to fry some button mushrooms. He grilled slices of tomato. He poached a single
brown egg to perfection. He toasted two slices of wholemeal bread, supplied by one of the finest
bakeries in London. These he spread with Harrods Raspberry and Redcurrant Conserve, his
favorite jam. He concentrated on his meal and felt quite virtuous that he wasn&#8217;t lingering over the
Times with a second cuppa.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He washed up and then fussed some more in the bathroom &#8211; one couldn&#8217;t stint on good grooming  &#8211;
before carefully dressing for his appointment. He wore his Brioni suit, his shirt from Bond street,
and his shoes from Church&#8217;s</span>

<span style="color: #000000">. He felt &#8211; and looked &#8211; like a million dollars. Whistling, he left the
flat. The driver he had prearranged was waiting. He was driven to his appointment in a luxury
limo. He went straight to the appointment with Mr. Smithers, solicitor with Bumbridge,
Cleasthorpe, and Cogswaite. He was late.</span></p>

Mr. Steele agreed, though he thought it a bit late to be bringing up Lord Claridge's death again.
As he exited the offices, he finally took in his surroundings. It was a beautiful day &#8211; &#8220;jacket

<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Remington had changed into more casual &#8211; for him &#8211; attire. He had also undone the top buttons
of his shirt and rolled up the sleeves. In celebration of unloading the castle, he had decided to treat
Laura to a meal featuring traditional British fare. He was making a clear soup, a salmon mousse
with roasted tomato sauce, oven-roasted potatoes, spring vegetables, and a pudding</span>

Laura enter the flat, he came out of the kitchen into the dining room, wiping his hands on a towel
and removing his apron. He greeted Laura with a light kiss.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"A good thing I'm<i> not </i>related to Lord Claridge, eh?" He nodded toward the paper that lay open
on the dining room table. When she didn&#8217;t respond, he leaned to the right, ducking his head to try
to catch her eye. &#8220;Laura?&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She looked directly at him. "You'd better sit down."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He hesitated, noted her look, and then sat at the table. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;m sitting.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She took a few paces away from him and then turned, saying, "One time during a case you told
me that it was one thing to conceal your past by design, another to have it concealed from you.&#8221;</span>

<p><span style="color: #000000">"Yes."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"At the end of that case, however, you said there are bits and pieces of your past that are obscure
to you, and at moments you realize they're less painful that way."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura&#8217;s voice softened. "Would you want me to fill in a bit of your past, knowing you will find it . . .
painful?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A reflex arc was activated: &#8220; walk out &#8211; don&#8217;t find out &#8211; run away.&#8221; Overridden. "Just tell me,
Laura."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She hesitated a moment longer, and he swore he could read her thought: Icy Calm.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"I met with Lady Claridge this morning. Lord Claridge believed, and it&#8217;s entirely possible, that . . .
you<i> are</i> his son."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He didn&#8217;t know what he had expected, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t that. &#8220;What&#8217;re you talkin&#8217; about,
Laura? Daniel &#8211; " He stopped when he saw her shake her head, when he saw her conviction. He
dropped his eyes, took a breath. Step-by-step, mate, step-by-step. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He focused on her words: Lord Claridge&#8217;s son. So. He <i>had </i>seen recognition in Lord Claridge&#8217;s
eyes that day. He looked back up at her."Lord Claridge believed me to be Sean James, after all."
His voice was even.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"No," Laura said softly.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">No?! His voice rose."Then who the bloody hell &#8211; "</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"The son of Lord Claridge and a . . . a woman whom, he said, you look remarkably like.&#8216;The very
image&#8217; were his words."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Who was she?&#8221; His voice became very soft. He had only been told that his mother had died at his
birth. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Again that hesitation.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;A prostitute. That&#8217;s all he knew.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Some unknown prostitute. His breath caught; then, involuntarily, his glance fell to the newspaper
on the table before him, and he winced as further implications of her words hit him. Abruptly, he
pushed away from the table, stood, paced away from her, turned, and began again, angrily, though
he wasn't exactly sure toward whom his anger was directed, "No. Why would Daniel lie to me,
what possible reason &#8211; "</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"This was coming out,&#8221;she said, gesturing toward the paper.&#8220;He told Lady Claridge you should
be spared connection with it."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He looked down, licking his lower lip. His shoulders slumped.&#8220;Frankly, I prefer the story Daniel
told me at Ashford to all this.&#8221; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Perhaps he knew you would.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He turned away. He knew he hadn&#8217;t asked all the pertinent questions to fill in all the gaps. But
right now, he just couldn&#8217;t. Right now, if Laura thought it possible, that was good enough for him  &#8211;
she would have grilled Lady Claridge thoroughly. Laura he trusted. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Turning back, he looked directly at her."Do I have a name?"</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">"If you do, Lord Claridge didn't know it."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">No name. How fitting. He felt like Tantalus, straining for the fruit always just beyond his grasp.
Absently, he wondered if there was a movie annotation for that. Laura was speaking; he forced his
attention back to her.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know about<i> you </i>until I showed him the watch. . . .&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He merely nodded. If Lord Claridge was his father, then he <i>hadn&#8217;t</i> been abandoned, as he had
always believed: one can only abandon what one knows one has. That was hardly a comforting
thought.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura had paused and now continued. &#8220; Lady Claridge had blood drawn upon Lord Claridge's
death . . . for paternity testing. . . . You could be tested. Being illegitimate, you couldn&#8217;t inherit
his title, of course, but if you are his son he wanted to acknowledge you. In his will he provided
for a large amount of unentailed property to go to &#8211; &#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Abruptly, Steele turned and strode from the room and out the door. He heard Laura call "Mr.
Steele!" as he closed the door with a bit more force than necessary. </span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura hurried toward the window and watched as he moved down the street, hands in pockets,
head down, shoulders forward &#8211; not his usual proud military bearing. Exhausted, she sank onto
the couch and stared into space, no longer the controlled, objective Laura she had needed to be
just moments ago &#8211; not only for herself, but for him.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Remington strode along as if he could somehow outpace his thoughts and feelings. Eventually he
slowed, began to breathe again. The swirl in his mind slowly coalesced into recognizable thought:
a father. For more than thirty years he had gone without one. Now, in a space of days, two men &#8211;
two ghosts &#8211; had laid claim to that title; one had already been unmasked as a pretender.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Remington stopped walking. He reached into his pocket, pulled out the watch, opened its cover,
and began to listen to the tune, &#8220;When Irish Eyes are Smiling.&#8221; Memories of his last day with
Daniel overtook him.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel had stood before him in the master bedroom of the castle. Giving him Lord Claridge&#8217;s
pocket watch, Daniel said Harry had been right &#8211; his real father <i>had</i> stolen the watch &#8211; and
&#8220;confessed&#8221; to being that father. Believing that Daniel, for the past twenty years, had selfishly
kept this from him, thus essentially &#8211; <i>needlessly</i> &#8211; depriving him of his father for that time, simply
in order to avoid his anger, he lashed out at him, flung that bloody pocket watch back at him, and
left the room. He then walked the estate for hours.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Mildred came upon him. He had to force himself to stop when she ran to catch up to him. He
couldn&#8217;t hide his distress, and, when she asked what was wrong, he told her of Daniel&#8217;s
&#8220;revelation.&#8221; She played devil&#8217;s advocate, saying Daniel hadn&#8217;t been there for him when he had
needed him most, urging him to &#8220;make him pay.&#8221; When he started to walk away again, she
grabbed him, saying, "Oh, Boss. Boss. Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Is this the way you
want it to go down?" And he knew it was not. The past was over. Gone. Pffffft. But the future . . .</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He went back to Daniel&#8217;s room, briefly observed him, unseen, and, after a few moments&#8217;
consideration, plunged right in, recalling the con he and Daniel were playing the time Daniel
bought the suit he was now wearing. Daniel turned toward him, relieved. Smiling and laughing,
they briefly reminisced about some of their other cons together, feeling their way back to each
other. Then they held each other in a tight embrace &#8211;  the first as &#8220;father and son.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He had turned to pour the two of them a celebratory drink, saying to Daniel, &#8220;Perhaps there's
something you can finally tell me. Lord knows, Laura's been bothering me enough all these years 
&#8211; anyway, what I'd like to know is . . . what's my real name?" Turning back, drinks in hand, he
had discovered that Daniel, sitting in the settee across from him, had quietly died in the space of
those few moments. . . . </span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The music stopped playing. Remington looked down at the watch in his hand. It needed to be
wound. He closed its cover and returned it to his pocket without doing so. He started walking
again. Daniel had certainly caused him to run the gamut of emotion that day. Now, he just felt
numb. Daniel hadn&#8217;t meant to hurt him. He knew that. Daniel could just never comprehend that,
over the past few years with Laura, his &#8220;Harry&#8221; had come to fully embrace his &#8220;Remington&#8221;
persona, a man who, in the end, preferred a hard truth over a more comfortable lie.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And it certainly was a hard truth, if truth it were. His thoughts turned to Lord Claridge . . . and to
his mother.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He could accept her being a prostitute. He himself had been a throwaway child; it was painful, but
not surprising, to discover that apparently his mother had also been one of the disposables of
society, and he knew the activities to which such turned when faced with no other means of
survival.<i> That </i>he could understand.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">As for Lord Claridge . . . Remington had known about Whitechapel. He and Laura had each
separately learned of <i>those </i>beatings a year ago: he, while tracking down the owner of the watch;
Laura, while tracking down him. Before he had first been presented to Lord Claridge, Laura had
told him Lord Claridge was a reformed man, thanks to the love of Catherine. And he had been
prepared to accept, indeed to welcome, Lord Claridge as his father, if such was the case. After all,
he had told himself, he himself was an example of the change a woman could precipitate: he was
hardly in the position to cast stones.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But . . . did this reformation truly outweigh all that had come to light since that time? Could he
accept a man who for more than<i> thirty years </i>had sadistically battered women? Could he forgive a
man who, in all probability, had beaten his own <i>mother</i>? Could he embrace a man who had sought
his illegitimate son Sean desperately, but had rejected <i>him</i> &#8211; his mother&#8217;s &#8220;very image&#8221; &#8211; on sight,
likely <i>because</i> of that sight, and had only had a change of heart as his life had drawn to a close?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Weren&#8217;t all these questions moot? A &#8220;yes&#8221; to them could mean he&#8217;d inherit some property, but,
though he could hear Daniel turning over in his grave, that didn&#8217;t matter to him. He had only
sought his father to have that simple, human bond and to know a part of whom he himself was. A
&#8220;yes&#8221; could not make that possible with Lord Claridge, even if he were still to desire it.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">His answer to these questions really only mattered in here &#8211; he put a hand to his chest.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He stopped, bowed his head, and closed his eyes tightly. He knew what the answer of a saint
would be. He just didn&#8217;t think he could be that heavenly-minded. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Taking a deep breath, he lifted his head. At the end of his life, Lord Claridge had become
desperate enough to claim him as a son, but<i> he</i> was not desperate enough for a father to claim
Lord Claridge.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He started walking again.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He had walked for hours. Without his being aware of it, his feet had taken him to Brixton, where
he had lived in the streets, alone, during his young years. He stood there, hands in pockets, and
took in the sights and sounds. It was changed yet familiar. The memory of his first meeting of
Daniel came unbidden to his mind. He gave a small half-smile. He had picked the toff's pocket.
Daniel. Not an auspicious beginning to a friendship. Daniel, nevertheless, saw potential in his
fourteen-year-old self and took him under his wing, away from his dreary hand-to-mouth
existence. Educated him. The stated purpose being to qualify him to help Daniel pull off his cons
of the wealthy, of course, but true affection had developed between them &#8211; though young &#8220;Harry&#8221;
would have denied it.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">That chance meeting had changed the course of his life &#8211; just as had meeting Laura. His smile
broadened. Also not a promising beginning, trying to steal the jewels she had been hired to
protect. But a beginning that had shifted the direction of his life again, and he was finally &#8220;on
course.&#8221; He was truly thankful for these two people who had taken the gamble to involve him in
their lives: Laura, now his wife; Daniel . . .   after all was said and done, the closest thing to a
father he had ever had.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The numbness finally left him. Blood circulated again around his heart.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He shook himself and gave a small, mirthless laugh. Enough of this. All in all, he was a man who
lived in the present.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It was very late. As Remington entered the flat, he remembered the meal he had been making. He
stuck his head into the kitchen, prepared for the worse. Well, Laura had at least thought to turn
off burners and put the food in the refrigerator. He wouldn't attest to her actually having salvaged
it. She wasn't much of a cook. She had even washed up. He would have to make it up to her. He
went through the bedroom into the shower, grinning as he thought of just how he could make it
up to her. . . .</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He didn't want to wake her now. He slipped beneath the covers, trying not to disturb her, but
pressing his whole body as close to hers as he could without actually touching, savoring her
nearness.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Laura, of course, hadn't done more than doze off now and again, and she turned to face him. They
gazed into each other&#8217;s eyes as the soft moonlight filtered into the room. Then they made love
tenderly, not saying a word. Afterwards, Laura felt wetness on his cheeks and tasted the salt of
tears. She held him in her arms as he wept in near silence.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">****</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Almost immediately upon their return from London, Lady Claridge informed them that the team
of detectives Lord Claridge had hired in a last, desperate attempt to find Sean had finally managed
to trace him. He had died, at a young age, of tuberculosis.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Six weeks had passed, and things were back to normal at Remington Steele Investigations in Suite
1157 of the Century Towers. Laura and Steele had gone out to meet with a client, but Steele
returned to the office early. He needed to prepare a few notes for the luncheon address he was
going to give in a few hours. Or so he had said. Mildred was out running errands; consequently,
he was the only one there when the postal worker arrived.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He flipped through the post. Bill, junk mail, invitation, junk mail, client payment, junk &#8211; no &#8211; he
looked again at the return address. This was the laboratory report on the paternity testing. This
would give him the percentage probability he was Lord Claridge's son.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">He took the envelope into his office. Placed it on his desk. Took out the watch and placed it next
to the letter. Turned. Looked out the window, hands in pockets.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The End.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Endnote: Though I would love to be able to say the words are entirely my own, the line about
blood circulating again around his heart owes its inspiration to something PB was supposed to
have said concerning the mourning period after Cassie&#8217;s death.</span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She made her way back to Ireland. After the attack, all she wanted was to go home. Her parents,
from whom she had run away, took her back in. When they discovered she was pregnant, they
nearly turned her back out. Instead, they punished her more cruelly.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It was a hard birth, probably due to complications from the beating she had received. She was too
weak and ill to prevent them from taking him from her.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I baptize ye in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.&#8221; Too ashamed to have his
existence publicly acknowledged, they didn&#8217;t have his birth recorded, but being good Catholics,
they didn&#8217;t deny him baptism, which they performed themselves. They didn&#8217;t name him, saying
that whoever took him in could name him what they would. They sent him on to a relative who
knew a family willing to take him in, at least temporarily. When the burden of caring for him
became too great, he was passed on. And passed on again. And again.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She begged to see him, and, occasionally, on condition that she not make known her relationship
to him and stay in the background, she was allowed. Not that there was much of a chance he
would remember her: her visits were too infrequent, the child was too young. Each time she saw
him, he was with a different family, being called by a different name. What remained the same was
the uncaring attitude. He was not wanted.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">She was there in Dublin the day he ran away. He was in trouble, again. She watched as he got
caught stealing an apple from a display stand while his current &#8220;guardians&#8221; were haggling with the
shopkeeper. He never looked as if he got enough to eat. They were whipping him with a switch
when he suddenly broke away, running as if for his life. Perhaps he was.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">A half-hearted attempt was made to follow him but soon abandoned. With a mother&#8217;s
determination, however, she kept him in her sights. He made his way to the docks, ran onto a
ship, and disappeared. She followed, concealing herself as well. When the ship docked in London,
she made her way off, searching for him. But she could not find him. Her nine-year-old son.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">In London she resumed her old &#8220;profession&#8221; and continued to search. A few years passed. The
barkeeps in the seedy parts of town became familiar with her as she wandered the city, plying her
trade, searching for him, growing older. One in Brixton, in particular, a barkeep named Paddy
O&#8217;Rourke, became her friend and confidant. She told him of her son. She even showed him the
watch she had kept safely with her all these years and told how she had lifted it from the man who
was her boy&#8217;s father.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">And then one day, in her twenty-eighth year, as she and Paddy were together unlocking the bar, a
lad, thin, and tall for his age, came racing toward them with several older, heftier boys in close
pursuit. &#8220;Paddy, t&#8217;is he!&#8221; she cried. The older boys caught up to the lad just in front of the bar and
pummeled him mercilessly. Paddy joined the fray, trying to rescue the young one. She looked on,
terrified. Her boy, despite his bloodied face, looked more like her than ever. As soon as he could
wriggle free, however, he was off, running with the speed only a burst of adrenalin could supply.
Unfortunately, Paddy was unable to pursue him: one of the older boys had now pulled a knife on
him, and he was on the defensive. Only the bobby&#8217;s whistle, sounding closer and closer, finally
caused the boys to disperse.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy walked back to her, put an arm around her as she stood there trembling, and then drew her
back into the bar. She never saw her son again. That winter, feeling herself succumbing to the
cold, to the hard life on the streets, she gave the watch to Paddy.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Promise me, Paddy, if it ever be in your power, you&#8217;ll give this watch to my gossoon</span>

<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy stared at the watch, swinging from the chain he held in his hand, and then looked down at
the blank piece of paper on his desk. After all this time, more than twenty years since her death,
he knew who her son was: the former pupil of Paddy&#8217;s friend, Daniel Chalmers.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy had left London close to five years ago and had returned to Kerry Clare, where he had
been brought up. He had been sickened, at that time, to discover the identity of her boy&#8217;s father:
Kevin Landers, the &#8220;K.L.&#8221; of the watch. Paddy had been a barkeep in Whitechapel then. He was
ashamed of himself as he thought of how, before his discovery, he had shielded the man from the
police. Landers had had the nasty habit of getting bolloxed</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> and then gleefully beating up
prostitutes. He had paid Paddy <i>very</i> well for his protection. Paddy had greedily obliged, inuring
himself to the plight of the prostitutes.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But that had all changed. . . .  Paddy recalled the events leading up to his current task, beginning
with that night at the bar.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It had been after hours, and Paddy had looked over at Landers, still sitting there, as drunk as a l&#8211;&#8211;
. . . very drunk.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Landers asked Paddy if he had ever told him about his &#8220;first,&#8221; an Irish whore who was no more
than a child. About how good beating her had felt. About how it had led him to seek out that
same thrill time and again. Paddy tried to hustle him out the door, but the bloody sot became
furious, grabbed hold of him, and forced him to hear every sordid detail. His only regret, Landers
said, was the damned bitch had stolen his watch. &#8220;It played a lovely tune,&#8221; he slurred. &#8220;When Irish
Eyes are Smilin&#8217;. It was inscribed, too. &#8216;To S.J. from K.L.&#8217; &#8221; He was too drunk to consider that
this might be an incautious admittance.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy&#8217;s heart nearly stopped. He was finally able to wrench himself away, tearing his shirt. He
went to the jacks</span>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16', WPFootnote16 )"><img src="stainedsteele/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

<span style="color: #000000">, vomited, and then continued to retch for a good half-hour more. The next
day, he made an anonymous call to the police, identifying Landers as the perpetrator of the
Whitehead beatings, threatening to go to the papers if something wasn&#8217;t done about it. He later
learned Kevin Landers was none other than the Earl of Claridge. He left soon after for Ireland.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Once there, he took to drinking too much and drifted aimlessly from job to job. He spent most of
his time down at the tracks, becoming involved in some shady dealings there. Occasionally these
dealings took him back to London and to the racetracks there. On one of those trips, he met
Daniel Chalmers and became involved in one of<i> his </i>schemes. Daniel was out of his league, of
course, when it came to cons and scheming, but Paddy proved useful enough. He and Daniel
became friends and hooked up from time to time when they were both in London.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This last time, Daniel invited him back to his flat for drinks. Paddy, once again, drank too much.
In the course of trying to find his way back from the bathroom, he ended up in one of the
bedrooms. It looked essentially unlived in &#8211; devoid of the usual personal touches one might
expect. Except for a remarkable framed sketch. He recognized the quay in Dublin, drawn from the
perspective of a departing ship. The artist somehow managed to convey both a sense of loss and
hope. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Daniel came in.&#8220;Wondered where you wandered off to. . . .&#8221; </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;This is amazin&#8217;.&#8221; Paddy gestured toward the picture.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Harry, my former protege, drew it. I have a few more of his drawings. Would you like to see
them?&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy nodded.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got them well hidden. Perilous, you know, for a man in my profession to keep around items
of too personal a nature.&#8221; He left the room and returned a few minutes later with the drawings.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy was looking through the half-dozen or so drawings when he stopped short. It was she. He
sobered immediately.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Yes, I like that one too. Harry said it was just a woman he had seen in Brixton one day. He
discarded it, as he did with all his drawings. But it was one of the ones I salvaged. I was struck
with the similarities he had drawn to himself.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Do you have a picture of Harry, then?&#8221; Somehow, Paddy just knew. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;Not really a picture. Too dangerous. But I <i>do</i> have a scrapbook of newspaper clippings from all
over the Continent, devoted to stories of rare artifacts. There&#8217;s one on the Hapsburg Dagger that
has Harry&#8217;s picture. It doesn&#8217;t look out of place there.&#8221; Daniel retrieved the scrapbook and
showed him the picture.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It was her boy, the one he had tried to &#8220;rescue&#8221; outside his bar in Brixton that day, long-ago.
&#8220;Remington Steele,&#8221; he read from the caption under the picture.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s calling himself these days.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">&#8220;How did you meet him? What was his background?&#8221; Paddy hoped his questions wouldn&#8217;t seem
too prying.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">But Daniel, slightly tipsy, didn&#8217;t seem to notice. &#8220;Oh, he was a half-wild street urchin when I met
him, in Brixton. He&#8217;s never told me much of his background. Said his mother died when he was
born. Knows nothing of his father &#8211; harbors a great deal of anger toward him, I can tell you that.
Said he was passed from family to family as a young boy in Ireland. Ran away. Jumped a ship.
Ended up in London when he was nine or ten, he thinks.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy had excused himself as quickly as he could thereafter.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Now he sat, trying to compose a note. &#8220;Your mother wanted you to have this,&#8221; he wrote. He 
crumpled up the paper and took out another sheet. He wanted to entice Steele to see him. Steele
thought his mother dead, so although that note might arouse some curiosity in him as to how
Paddy knew his mother and what he could tell him about her, Steele would probably just ring him
up. And what Paddy had to tell him, he didn&#8217;t want to say in a telephone conversation. His mother
<i>had</i> died, though not in the manner Steele thought. Paddy couldn&#8217;t lie about that. That would be
too cruel. But if he put &#8220;Your<i> father </i>wanted you to have this,&#8221; Paddy could make sure they met
face-to-face, if Steele wanted to pursue it. Then Paddy would tell him Lord Claridge was Steele&#8217;s
father. And if Lord Claridge wouldn&#8217;t recognize Steele and give him an inheritance, then Paddy
would further tell Steele about the hushed-up Whitechapel beatings, about Lord Claridge having
beaten Steele&#8217;s own mother. <i>That</i> would anger him enough to blackmail Lord Claridge into giving
him his rightful inheritance. One way or the other, his mother would be avenged.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Paddy scribbled the note and then sent it and the watch by the next post.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The End </span></p>
