<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura checked her watch. 5:30 p.m. &#8220;I wish he&#8217;d wake up. We only get a half-hour to
see him.&#8221; Medicinal smells, disinfectant smells, assaulted her.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve been questioning him since three this morning. He&#8217;s probably zonked.&#8221;
Murphy slouched in the chair next to hers, going through Steele&#8217;s medical charts. &#8220;On
top of that he&#8217;s got a fever of over 102.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I <i>thought</i> he was babbling at UCLA.&#8221; She laughed quietly, sadly, looking over at the
figure in the bed. While at the UCLA Medical Center, Steele had undergone not only
medical treatment for his injuries but also a prebooking inspection and interview by
the police. She&#8217;d tried to hover as close as she could, and as they&#8217;d readied him for
transfer to the Medical Center at the L.A. County Jail, she&#8217;d overheard him recounting
seemingly every single jail movie he&#8217;d ever seen. He&#8217;d ranged from &#8216;Birdman of
Alcatraz&#8217; to &#8216;Stir Crazy.&#8217; On the way, he&#8217;d made a stop for an oration on &#8216;One of the
last great men-in-chains films, &#8220;Cool-Hand Luke.&#8221; A man refuses to conform to life on
a prison farm, to compromise with authority&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; she hadn&#8217;t thought him very
circumspect, given his audience. He&#8217;d then taken a detour through &#8216;Of course one of
Newman&#8217;s greatest films is &#8220;The Sting.&#8221; Two gentlemen set out to fleece a racketeer in
1930's Chicago, pitting brain against brawn and pistol.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Anything else on the chart?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy replaced the clipboard at the foot of the bed. &#8220;They took cultures. No results
back yet. He&#8217;ll be on intravenous antibiotics four times a day. The wound on his arm
has to be kept elevated and immobilized for five days.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She looked over at the bed&#8217;s occupant. &#8220;I wish he&#8217;d wake up.&#8221; Still, she spoke softly.
He did need his sleep. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she wished he&#8217;d wake up.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;When&#8217;s the next time we can see him?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She almost smiled: Murphy, asking when he could see Steele. &#8220;Monday. If he&#8217;s still
here. Visiting hours are Saturdays and Mondays, 10:30 - 3:30 and 5:30 - 6:45. But . .
. inmates&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; how she hated using that word for him&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;only get two thirty-minute visits
per week, at most two visitors at a time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;d Detective Chritz have to say?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe what Mr. Steele directed him to.&#8221; She showed him the
notes she&#8217;d taken during her conversation with Chritz an hour ago:</span></span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">1.&#8216;Water Lilies, 1904.&#8217; Monet. Taken from French art dealer Paul Rosenberg, whose
gallery represented major masters of the School of Paris. The painting was part of a
collection amassed for Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in 1941.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Estimated worth: $11-14 million.</span></span></p>

Yekaterinsky Palace.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Worth: ?</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">3.&#8216;Portrait of Christ.&#8217; Jacopo de Barbari. Originally stolen from Schwarzburg Castle in
Germany, allegedly by American soldiers who were part of a unit ordered to guard the
castle. Hundreds of works of art from the Weimar city museum had been sent there
for safekeeping during the Allied bombing of Germany.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Estimated worth: $2.8 million.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">4.A D&uuml;rer drawing is also suspected to be a stolen item, but this has not yet been
verified. Since, however, it was well hidden, it&#8217;s a good bet it is.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Estimated worth if authenticated: $5.6 million.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">5.Not yet recovered: the amber-and-royal lavulite mosaic. Mr. Steele believes it was
originally stolen by Nazi troops from the famed eighteenth century &#8220;Amber Room&#8221; of
Peter the Great&#8217;s Yekaterinsky Palace.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy gave a low whistle after reading the list.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The recovery fees are going to be a couple million dollars.&#8221; Laura shook her head in
amazement.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy raised his voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s not getting them, is he?&#8221; Murphy glanced around and
then, straining with the effort, lowered his voice. &#8220;I mean, even if he didn&#8217;t steal the
other stuff, still, he didn&#8217;t tell us about this stuff. He was probably going to steal them
from Raeder and get his recovery fee. Just like he was going to do with the royal
lavulite,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; his voice rose again &#8211; &#8220;if we can believe that story, that is.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura shushed him and started to speak, but stopped, held her breath.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The figure on the bed was stirring. &#8220;Check out the ventilation system,&#8221; he mumbled.
&#8220;&#8216;Dr. No&#8217;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; His voice trailed off without completing the annotation, and he settled
back down without waking.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Great. All we need is him trying some &#8216;James Bond&#8217; escape through the air ducts.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura couldn&#8217;t help chuckling. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you just see it? Mr. Steele crawling through the
ducts, dragging his IV tubing behind him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She elbowed Murphy, and he finally, reluctantly, unleashed a smile, even gave in to a
chuckle of his own.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Anyway, about the fees,&#8221&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;she winked at him&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;Remington Steele will do the right
thing, believe me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;ve you got up your sleeve?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;These beds have ears, Murph.&#8221; She returned his evil grin, then shifted in her seat.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something that&#8217;s still a mystery, though. Apparently Samuel Goldschmidt
offered the use of his own firm&#8217;s lawyers to Mr. Steele for his defense, and Mr. Steele
accepted. Goldschmidt&#8217;s sending one of them, a Mr. Cohen, out to meet with me
tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see the D.A. together on Monday, if charges are brought. No
explanation of why Goldschmidt&#8217;s so eager to help a man he thought crossed him or
why Mr. Steele would accept.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Not only that, Mr. Goldschmidt said he&#8217;s sending $36,000 along with Cohen to give
to Mr. Steele for recovery, and I don&#8217;t think he meant medical recovery.&#8221; She nodded
toward Steele. &#8220;He&#8217;s still got quite a bit of explaining to do.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy snorted. &#8220;Think he&#8217;ll tell you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;If he wants to regain the use of his arm.&#8221; She checked her watch again. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got
to get back. I want to go over the tape again, look over the case file, and prepare
some more notes for my meeting with Cohen tomorrow.&#8221; She got up to leave, looked
again at Steele and started to reach out a hand, but then turned and strode out of the
ward.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura rolled over and glowered at the clock. 1 A.M. and still no sleep. Twenty-six
hours before the D.A. was required to make a decision. Sighing, she threw back the
covers. She missed Steele.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura, dressed in a purloined nursing outfit, stared down at Steele. He was asleep but
shifting about in the bed and shivering. She didn&#8217;t know where the extra blankets
were kept. She reached out a hand but stopped just before contact. She could feel him
afire with fever. She shouldn&#8217;t disturb him. She wanted to touch him. She had to do
something, or she&#8217;d draw attention. She lightly grasped his wrist and pretended to
take his pulse.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He stirred and woke, blinking his eyes and squinting up at her. She was afraid he&#8217;d be
too tired or drugged to focus on her, but he smiled. He started to speak, but she
placed gentle fingers over his lips. He started to move his right hand but was stopped&nbsp;&#8211; a handcuff secured him to a steel bar.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Both arms immobilized. Oh, how she hated this. He looked like a butterfly pinned to a
board.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He kissed her fingers. She pretended to adjust his pillow and let her hand brush his
face, avoiding the now purplish-blue bruise. The sounds that had reverberated over
the earphones came back to her: Lona striking him. Suddenly overwhelmed, she put
her hand to her mouth and blinked back tears. He was looking at her, his brow
furrowed, his eyes questioning. She shook her head. Sweeping a silky, damp lock of
hair from his forehead, she bent down to plant a kiss&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Someone entered the ward and came toward her. Curses. Foiled. Again. She wondered
if Steele knew a film annotation for that one. She straightened up and strode toward
the night nurse. She nodded curtly toward Steele. &#8220;He needs another blanket.&#8221; She
exited before the bewildered woman could utter a sound, before this crazy escapade of hers could be exposed.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele followed Laura&#8217;s sylphlike figure with his eyes for as long as he could, then he
tried to lift his head so he could continue to follow her progress, so he could make
this delightful hallucination last a little longer. But his head was too heavy, and he let
it drop. Maybe she <i>had </i>been real&nbsp;&#8211; the part where a kiss had been interrupted
certainly reflected reality. He gave a tentative smile to the night nurse as she arranged
another blanket over him, but apparently the staff here was immunized against charm:
she performed the task efficiently, took his pulse, without warning popped a
thermometer in his mouth&nbsp;&#8211; nurses loved to do that&nbsp;&#8211; read the results, recorded
everything on his chart, and left, never directly looking at him. My, what an
enchanting place this was. Still, he didn&#8217;t expect to be here long. If plan A didn&#8217;t work
out, there was always plan B. He was just too muzzy from fever to recall the details
right now. Something about the ventilation system. Or had that been another
hallucination? Murphy had been helping him with the intravenous tubing, so it must&#8217;ve
been.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Though he categorically hated drugs, he wished the antibiotics would work a little
faster. First he was hot, then he was cold, then he was hot again, his eyelids felt like
coarse sandpaper rasping across his eyes, his head was pounding, he was thirsty and
he couldn&#8217;t find a call button&nbsp;&#8211; did jail wards have those?&nbsp;&#8211; and he was so damned
tired&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Harry, you are the biggest baby when you&#8217;re sick,&#8221; Daniel said to him.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Am not.&#8221; Hold on. Now he really <i>was</i> hallucinating. Daniel couldn&#8217;t possibly be here.
God, he hoped he hadn&#8217;t said that out loud. Next thing he&#8217;d know, they&#8217;d be carting
him off to the loony bin. But Daniel was wrong. <i>Carl </i>held the distinction of being the
most obnoxious person to be around when he was confined to bed. Take that time of
the Goldschmidt fiasco. Those animals&nbsp;&#8211; the Palermo Brothers and the Brothers Grimm
&#8211; had beaten Carl within an inch of his life, just for fun. John had nursed Carl back to
health with the aid of an old friend in Munich, a doctor, an old German Jew who&#8217;d
survived the war. And though John could be patient when Carl was muttering his
complaints while squirming with fever, it&#8217;d gotten a little trying when Carl was out of
danger but still demanding John be at his beck and call. Yet, it&#8217;d been all right. &#8216;He

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">, therefore he is.&#8217; That was all that had mattered.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It&#8217;d probably seemed far worse than it was because he&#8217;d also had to contend with
Goldschmidt. While Carl was recuperating, John had found out, as expected, that the
Hals had again gone missing. He&#8217;d found out, as<i> not</i> expected, that Goldschmidt
blamed him, believing he&#8217;d arranged it. Or rather, Goldschmidt blamed Michael
O&#8217;Leary, since that was the name Goldschmidt had known him by. John/Michael had
been insulted, believing his reputation should speak for him. He&#8217;d had an urge to tell
the man, using an equivalent, rather coarse Irish idiom, that he didn&#8217;t bite the hand
that fed him, but Carl had intervened and had managed to at least smooth things to
the point where Goldschmidt accepted that Michael would do no such thing. All
John/Michael had gotten out of the whole affair was the promise that Goldschmidt
wouldn&#8217;t have him hunted down, a promise evidently given to Carl reluctantly, since
Goldschmidt had wanted his retainer fee returned. John and all his incarnations had
never seen how that could possibly be a fair request.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele shifted uncomfortably in the bed, not entirely because of the fever. Though his
holding back the full extent of Carl&#8217;s role in the Goldschmidt debacle surely hadn&#8217;t
affected this case in any way not already covered by his other obfuscations, it
reminded him that Laura had yet to have her full say on this Raeder thing. He chewed
his lip. What was in store for him when she did? Perhaps he should ask the warden to
revoke all his visitor privileges for the duration of his incarceration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura stood staring into Steele&#8217;s wall-to-wall closet, mouth open, body slack. She
straightened up, shook her head, and gave a sigh. &#8220;No wonder no one can find any
skeletons in his closet. They can&#8217;t dig them out from underneath all these suits! What
does one man need with so many suits?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Beats me,&#8221; Murphy called from the living room. &#8220;I could think of better things to
spend my money on.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, yeah? Like what?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Beer and pizza.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, Murph. You&#8217;d rival the Goodyear Blimp.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yeah, guess so. Did you really get hold of those furniture guys? Today? On a <i>Sunday</i>?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yep. Money really does talk. The whole place&#8217;ll be redone by the time he gets out of
the hospital.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">There was a silence for a moment. It might be out of the hospital bed into the jail cell.
If charges were brought, she doubted he&#8217;d be granted bail. She sighed. Twelve more
hours.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She gathered up an armful of suits and laid them on the bed&nbsp;&#8211; good thing it was king-size. &#8220;Anyway, I gave Bernice the job of tracking down his posters. I hope she can get
them. They&#8217;re the only things in this place that say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;him.&#8217;&#8221; Well, she didn&#8217;t
have a name to fill in there. That was the best she could do. Without the posters the
place could&#8217;ve passed for a very elegant model apartment, as empty of him as the top
of his office desk. Well, not quite true&nbsp;&#8211; the contents of his refrigerator still identified
the place as his.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The whole place&#8217;ll look just like new.&#8221; She took another armful of suits, pausing, a
wave of wistfulness washing over her as she caught the lingering scent of his cologne.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;ll take his tailor to repair all these.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You think he&#8217;d actually notice if he was missing a couple?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He might.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy chuckled and came to the bedroom door. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m all finished cleaning up
the mess out here.&#8221; He came and helped her, each grabbing another armful of suits. &#8220;I
just hope he appreciates all this.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He should. He&#8217;s paying for it for once.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And that&#8217;s not the half of it.&#8221; He kept a straight face for as long as he could, as did
Laura, then they abandoned themselves to laughter. The more they tried to stop, the
more it got away from them. They collapsed onto the bed with their armloads and
ended up on the floor, leaning back against the bed, side-by-side, rag-doll limp.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy wiped his eyes. God, it was so good to see Laura laugh again. &#8220;Too bad you
couldn&#8217;t get your hands on that money from Goldschmidt. Boy, I&#8217;d love to be there
when you tell Steele about the recovery fees.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll make sure you are. I&#8217;ll need back-up protection.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy glanced at her, and the grin left his face.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What is it, Murph?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I was going to tell you later, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I might as well tell you now.&#8221; He puffed out
his lips with a breath. &#8220;Look. I&#8217;ll stay until he&#8217;s cleared. Longer, if you need me to help
nail Raeder. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;ve decided to go back to Denver. Be around my family, open my
own agency&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, Murphy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Laura touched his hand, but no more words came out. Finally, she
touched his hand again. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t go. How will I ever run this agency without you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He took her hand in his own. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Laura. But I just can&#8217;t stay. You&#8217;ll do fine.
You&#8217;ll do brilliantly, as always. Other detectives will be knocking down your door to
work for &#8216;The Great Remington Steele.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She pulled her hand from his. &#8220;You know I can&#8217;t do that. We may be able to fool the
public, but another detective working right here in the agency? They&#8217;d find him out. I
can&#8217;t trust anyone else.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy sighed, dropped his eyes, shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Laura. But I&#8217;ve got to
leave. I broke a cardinal rule of investigating. &#8216;Don&#8217;t let your emotions affect your
judgement.&#8217;&#8221; He looked into her eyes. &#8220;The one I was accusing you of breaking.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I think we both broke it.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No. You were willing to believe he was innocent until proven guilty. I wanted to
believe he was guilty. If it hadn&#8217;t been for you, I would&#8217;ve gone out of my way to prove
he was.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that, Murphy. You&#8217;re not that kind of person. You
would&#8217;ve found the truth.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Maybe. But I would&#8217;ve tossed him in the slammer and thrown away the key first.&#8221; He
got up, helped her to her feet, and faced her directly. &#8220;I doubt he would&#8217;ve stuck
around after that. Good-bye &#8216;Remington Steele.&#8217;&#8221; His voice turned soft. &#8220;And I
would&#8217;ve hated myself for the rest of my life. Because of what it would&#8217;ve done to this
agency. And to you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She put her hand on his arm and rubbed it. &#8220;That didn&#8217;t happen. I don&#8217;t believe it
would&#8217;ve, either. You don&#8217;t need to go.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, I&#8217;m never going to trust him.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s good. Maybe that&#8217;s what&#8217;ll keep him honest.&#8221; They both grimaced at the
word. &#8220;Well, you know what I mean.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy shook his head. &#8220;No. I have to go. There&#8217;s one thing he&#8217;s stolen. Something
most precious. I have proof. And I can&#8217;t do a damn thing about it. And I&#8217;ll never
forgive him for it.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;What? What&#8217;s he stolen?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy felt a flash of jealousy at the intensity of feeling the con man&nbsp;&#8211; all right, Steele
&#8211; aroused in Laura: the waves of apprehension that surged through her iron grip on
his arm were hardly only due to her concern for her professional standing. But then he
sighed at the inevitable. He&#8217;d never had a chance. He&#8217;d been as noticeable as a candle
lit during a supernova.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He reached out a hand to her face, his lips forming the silent word, &#8220;You.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Surely it was past midnight now. Laura looked up from the paperwork she&#8217;d been
trying to distract herself with and scowled at the clock. The second hand was
deliberately moving slower, she knew it. And it looked like the D.A. was going to use
every second of his forty-eight hours to make his decision.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The morning meeting with Goldschmidt&#8217;s lawyer had gone great&nbsp;&#8211; what a shark! She
was certain they could fight this thing successfully, but it&#8217;d be so much better for the
agency if Steele wasn&#8217;t charged at all. She gave a rueful smile: no doubt Steele would
also think it better not to have to spend any time in a jail cell.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She turned her eyes to the phone, willing it to ring. She turned her eyes back to the
clock. Move, dammit.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">At 2 A.M. the phone finally rang. She leapt from the kitchen table to answer it. The
picture hanging next to it clattered to the floor. The glass broke.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Miss Holt?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It was Goldschmidt&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;Yes, Mr. Cohen.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Good news. The D.A. has decided not to charge Mr. Steele with any crime at this
time.&#8221; Laura felt like shrieking with joy, but let the man continue uninterrupted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
arranged for him to be transported back to the UCLA Medical Center.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;ll also be pleased to hear the matter of the Braque painting has been cleared up
as well, at least as far as Mr. Steele is concerned. There is a man, Jack Ritt, a forger &#8211; a
quite brilliant one, as a matter of fact&nbsp;&#8211; who loots museum libraries and national
archives for materials he can use to create seemingly ironclad provenances</span></span>

specializes in works by Braque, Picasso, and Klee, but he has changed and fabricated
the records of a wide variety of artists.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;So this Ritt faked the entire history of ownership of &#8216;Mr. Steele&#8217;s&#8217; Braque painting?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s up to the experts to sort that out. But the most important person in this chain, as
far as Mr. Steele is concerned, is the person who supposedly transferred ownership to
him, a Lionel Ackerman. Ackerman was long suspected of criminal activity involving
the acquisition and disposal of stolen artwork, though nothing could ever be proved.
But it made a plausible story that Mr. Steele stole the ruby and the mosaic for
Ackerman, or used Ackerman&#8217;s connections to fence them, and got the Braque
painting as payment.<i> But</i>, we&#8217;ve been able to show conclusively Mr. Steele never
received ownership of this painting. Those documents were forged.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Oh, Mr. Steele. What a web they wove for you. &#8220;What put the authorities onto Ritt?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ritt has crossed Mr. Goldschmidt&#8217;s path before. When Mr. Goldshmidt heard the
details of Mr. Steele&#8217;s predicament, he suspected Ritt&#8217;s involvement, not only because
of the nature of the posited forgery, but because Mr. Goldschmidt has long suspected
Erich Raeder is a client of Ritt&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ritt gives fake provenances to Raeder&#8217;s stolen art.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;When he can. He certainly couldn&#8217;t have pulled it off with &#8216;Water Lilies, 1904.&#8217; But you
can see that, though not his usual thing, taking on the project of Mr. Steele for Raeder
was well within Ritt&#8217;s field of expertise. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to prove it was
Ritt who forged the documents, let alone prove a Raeder-Ritt connection.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Another challenging project. Well, one step at a time. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Thank
you for all you&#8217;ve done. Now we can put full focus on getting the evidence the D.A.
needs to bring charges against the Raeders.&#8221; The confessions at the mansion didn&#8217;t
constitute proof.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;ve told Mr. Steele that Mr. Goldschmidt&#8217;s resources are at his disposal. My employer
has a keen interest in this case.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And she had a keen interest in knowing the full story behind that. &#8220;Mr. Steele will give
the matter his complete attention, I assure you. We&#8217;ll definitely pay a visit to this Mr.
Ackerman.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ackerman conveniently died Saturday.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura gasped, then gasped again as she remembered where she&#8217;d heard his name
before. &#8220;Foul play?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Cohen&#8217;s voice shrugged his answer. &#8220;Many of Ritt&#8217;s forged provenances involved old
men who were either dead or no longer had their full faculties by the time the
forgeries were discovered. Mr. Goldschmidt is of the opinion that either Ackerman was
in Erich Raeder&#8217;s pocket and died of natural causes&nbsp;&#8211; the man <i>was</i> terminally ill&nbsp;&#8211; or
the documents making him the former owner were forged as well, and he was
murdered to cover it up. The police are now taking a closer look at the circumstances
of Ackerman&#8217;s death.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;We&#8217;ll aid them in any way we can.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will. It&#8217;s been a pleasure to work with you, Miss Holt.&#8221; After they bade
goodbye, Laura hung up the phone and made a beeline for her study. She returned to
the kitchen with the case file and paged through it until she got to Officer &#8216;Mac&#8217;
McCarthy&#8217;s notes. &#8216;Tailed subject (Lora Raeder) to residence of Lionel Ackerman, age
93.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Had &#8216;Loralei&#8217; been sweetheart scamming Ackerman? Had she seduced him into being
part of the plot against Steele? Had she been part of a plot to hasten Ackerman to the
grave? Laura fully intended to report the visit of &#8216;Loralei&#8217; to Ackerman to the police,
but for now, she sank down in a kitchen chair, slid her arms along the table, and
rested her forehead upon it.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele was free.</span></span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Jack Ritt looked out of the aeroplane window and stretched. It was a shame he&#8217;d had
to cancel his meeting. He, as Professor Ritt, was to have met with a New York dealer at
the N.A.L. in order to confirm the authenticity of a Giacometti the dealer had
purchased and was now trying to sell. The director of the Alberto et Annette
Giacometti Association, who the dealer had first contacted, wouldn&#8217;t vouch for it. But
Ritt would. He had, years ago, created a London business, Art Research Associates,
through a middleman. Through this business he hired himself out as a professional
archivist. The middleman had connected the dealer with Professor Ritt, and Ritt had
been planning on showing the dealer the photograph of the Giacometti, which
appeared, plain as day, in the Ohana catalogue. It would then be obvious the
provenance of the painting was not in question. He had plenty of documentation to
back him up&nbsp;&#8211; a letter from its last owner before the dealer, Ackerman, now
conveniently dead, correspondence from a number of previous owners, not all of
whom existed, and a stack of concocted invoices tracing the path of the painting out
of Giacometti&#8217;s studio.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ritt sighed, pulling at his moustache. He&#8217;d been so looking forward to regaling the
dealer with a lavish lunch and tales of how he spent his time researching art lost to
the Nazis in WWII, while secretly revelling in the irony. But, he&#8217;d received word that it
was best he lay low for a while. Ritt wasn&#8217;t worried. Things would blow over&nbsp;&#8211; they
always did.</span></span></p>
<br>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, when can I get out of here? Five days. <i>Five days</i>. For five days they&#8217;ve not let
me move my arm. For five days I&#8217;ve not been able to eat&nbsp;&#8211; those damn drugs have
ruined my palate. And that insipid mess they claim is food is enough to put anyone&#8217;s

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura looked at him and humphed, popping one of his gift chocolates into her mouth.

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Payback, Miss Holt.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s it! I should just let you stay in here! I should just not tell you they&#8217;re releasing
you now! I should just tell the next nurse that walks by to get the biggest needle she
can find and stick you in the butt!&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They glared at each other.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele registered her words. &#8220;You mean I can go now?&#8221; he asked softly.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She shook her head at him, but a small smile formed on her face. She caressed his
good arm. &#8220;We&#8217;re just waiting on the paperwork.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, that took twelve hours at the jail hospital,&#8221; he groused, but without his former
vehemence.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It won&#8217;t be long. And then we can make up for lost time.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That sounds promising, Miss Holt.&#8221; As she leaned down, he closed his eyes in
anticipation of a kiss.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ready to leave, Steele?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He sighed in frustration at the intrusion of the voice of the bane of his current
existence at this most inopportune time. &#8220;Yes, Nurse Ratched.&#8221; &#8216;One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.&#8217; Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher. United Artists.1975.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s Rafferty, Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes, of course. I apologize. I&#8217;m not good with names. Just ask my receptionist, Miss
Wolfe.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Foxe,&#8221; Laura corrected.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I rest my case.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura brought his suit out from the closet. She patted the coat pockets. &#8220;What&#8217;s all
this?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shrugged. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve been flat on my back.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And busy while there, it seems.&#8221; She pulled out stacks upon stacks of little note
cards. &#8220;Emily, Samantha, Elizabeth, Jessica&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He saw her go scarlet as she read something on that last one. &#8220;Laura&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be much too busy catching up on your caseload to bother with these. I&#8217;ll
just take care of them for you, <i>sir</i>, while you get dressed.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221; He made a grab, but the nurse deftly blocked his way, and Laura scooted
out the door, defiantly scooping up a few more of his chocolates on her way.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He squeezed his eyes closed&nbsp;&#8211; if they were open, he&#8217;d scorch Nurse Ratched with their
glare. He&#8217;d heard they needed an iron hand in the psychiatric ward down at the
County Jail. Perhaps he could get her transferred. She&#8217;d be a natural.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, I&#8217;ve been thinking. Perhaps I should move to Brentwood. Or, if &#8216;Remington
Steele&#8217; smells of old money, Old Pasadena, or Palos Verdes, or Malibu, or&nbsp;&#8211; not Beverly
Hills though&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura continued to tug Steele down the hall to his apartment.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I could stay in a hotel until suitable accommodations are found&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She pushed him through the door. At first he just stood at the entrance, agape. She
followed after him, watching those long slender fingers brushing at this and that as he
took a slow tour of the place. She laughed when he got to the kitchen, rushed over to
the refrigerator, and threw the door open with alarm. &#8220;I tossed out everything that
looked like it might spoil.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh. Thank you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">In the bedroom he went first to the closet, full of the newly repaired suits, and stood
there, giving it a long, silent survey. Finally, he went to the posters on the wall behind
the couch. Bernice had found originals for them all: &#8216;Thin Man,&#8217; &#8216;Notorious,&#8217;
&#8216;Casablanca,&#8217; &#8216;Hotel Imperial.&#8217; He ran his hands over the frames, imperceptibly
straightening them.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">During his entire circuit of the apartment, he&#8217;d never once looked at her. Finally, he
turned to her, swallowed heavily, and said simply, softly, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She smiled and closed her eyes in anticipation as he bent his head down toward hers.
She opened one eye and then the other at the unaccountable delay. He had
straightened back up and was looking off into the distance, a puzzled frown on his
face.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, you amaze me. First you arrange for me to have a private room at the hospital
with nary a plea on my part. And to totally restore this apartment in these few days&nbsp;&#8211;
let alone get my tailor to restore my suits to sartorial splendour&nbsp;&#8211; must&#8217;ve cost you a
small fortune. Normally your pennies are practically howling from the grip you have on
them.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And things had been so peaceful. &#8220;You know the stolen artwork at the Raeders you
helped the police recover?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes?&#8221; His smile was one of anticipation.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, the recovery fees are yours &#8211; or rather, Remington Steele&#8217;s,&#8221; she added hastily
as his face started to light up.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The light was put out. &#8220;&#8216;Remington Steele&#8217;s.&#8217; Why do I get the uncomfortable feeling
you have a specific reason for making the distinction.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Remington Steele has decided to donate the fees, in his name, to the Beverly Hills and
Los Angeles Police Departments. And especially to the Art Theft Unit.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">His jaw dropped. He pushed his jacket back and put his fists on his hips. &#8220;What? Laura.
You&#8217;re not serious. I make the biggest score of my life&nbsp;&#8211; legitimately, mind you &#8211; and
you expect me to, to give it all away?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She glared right back at him, putting her own hands to her hips. She tried to keep her
voice under tight control. "I&#8217;d be a lot more convinced you&#8217;re entitled to use the word
&#8216;legitimate&#8217; if you&#8217;d told me about Raeder&#8217;s stolen art back when you first knew of it.
But that was just one more thing among many you kept from me." All her frustrations
with him gathered, gained force, rose up, and exploded out of her. "Why didn't you
tell me the truth?"</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The truth? The truth? I got tired of telling you the truth. I told you I didn&#8217;t steal the
ruby or the mosaic. What did that truth get me, eh? You didn&#8217;t believe me. You wanted
to keep an open mind. I was just one of the suspects to weigh your evidence against. I
was just a, a, a circle on your legal pad &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why should I have believed you? When your past rears its head, how am I supposed to
know when you&#8217;re telling the truth? You hide in evasions, half-truths, lies by omission,
outright falsehoods. Truth isn&#8217;t a tool to be selectively applied when you think it will
&#8216;get&#8217; you something! You&#8217;re damn right I wanted to keep an open mind. That&#8217;s more
than you d&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221; She broke off.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Hot black eyes flashed. He began to turn away, toward the door.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She reached out an arm to stop him, gently for once. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You were never
just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I <i>wanted</i> to believe you. I <i>hoped</i> to prove you were innocent.&#8221; That&#8217;s why
she&#8217;d swooped down those ropes, why she&#8217;d let him proceed with his final scheme
against the Raeders. Would it be enough for him?</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He stood there a few moments, his face turned away from her. Finally, he turned back
and searched her eyes. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, his features losing
their flinty look.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She squeezed his arm lightly. &#8220;But I need some explanations, Mr. Steele. Let&#8217;s back up,
start this conversation over again.&#8221; At his nod, she continued. &#8220;When did you know
this was Wallace&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s plot &#8211; the Raeders&#8217; plot&nbsp;&#8211; against you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Friday night, not too long before I called to ask for your help. Carl told me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me the real plan you and Carl cooked up to trap them?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shrugged slightly. &#8220;I thought it&#8217;d just be simpler that way. You do tend to want
lengthy explanations, and we were rather short on time.&#8221; He raised a hand to forestall
her retort. &#8220;My doing, I know. I didn&#8217;t want to have this hanging over my head any
longer. I saw a way to resolve it.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She decided to let that pass for the moment. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you follow the plan you told
me? For one thing, why didn&#8217;t Carl just keep Lona out of the way? True, it&#8217;s a stronger
case with her confession, but why&#8217;d you risk it?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Carl knew Lona well enough to convince me&nbsp;&#8211; and my experience of her backed this
up&nbsp;&#8211; that if she was face-to-face with me, she&#8217;d certainly want to gloat over how she&#8217;d
snared me. She was an easy mark.&#8221; He gave her a crooked smile.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You said you were going to use the Monet against Erich, threaten him into telling you
how he&#8217;d set you up. Why didn&#8217;t you just do that? Instead of you being in control of
the situation, you ended up with a gun on you &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Raeder has a need to be the conqueror. I believe he would&#8217;ve preferred seeing the
loss of the Monet rather than give in to a threat to report it. Even had I been able to
follow up on that threat, I&#8217;m sure he would&#8217;ve made the case I&#8217;d set him up&nbsp;&#8211; the
police would&#8217;ve been happy to add the Monet&#8217;s theft to the charges against me. We
would&#8217;ve gained nothing and stood to lose a lot more. Or if instead I&#8217;d threatened the
Monet&#8217;s destruction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Raeder is the most dispassionate man I&#8217;ve ever met. The
most&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. amoral. I believe it likely he would&#8217;ve said &#8216;go ahead.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura was stunned. &#8220;So if you&#8217;d made that threat, and he&#8217;d refused to give in&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele laughed without humor. &#8220;I&#8217;d have been in quite a bind.&#8221; He took a few steps
away from her before turning around to face her. &#8220;Raeder&#8217;s Achilles heel is his need to
dominate, to control. Throughout that night, in every way I could think of, I tried to
incite his desire to vanquish me. By doing that, and by being in the position where he
physically controlled me, dominated me, I, paradoxically, controlled him. Do you see?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She did now. &#8220;He&#8217;d want to make sure you heard the full story so he could relish your
total humiliation before killing you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele smiled uncertainly. &#8220;Good plan, eh?&#8221; When she didn&#8217;t answer, he walked back to
her, looking her directly in the eyes. &#8220;There were the secret passageways, and I knew
you and Murphy would be highly attuned to the proceedings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; he reminded her
soothingly. &#8220;In case I haven&#8217;t said it before, thank you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She pressed her lips together and nodded. &#8220;You still could have told me&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And would you still have agreed to let me do it? Knowing I was giving physical control
of the situation over to the Raeders and relying on the art of the con?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">How could she answer that? How could she say with certainty what she would&#8217;ve done
at a time already past? In principle, he&#8217;d done what a good PI would do&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d found
out what would motivate his suspect to confess and used that, but in application&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;I
would&#8217;ve evaluated the risks&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;When I called, your first reaction was to have me turn myself in. So you could proceed
in an orderly fashion. To my mind, that was a far greater risk if our goal was to expose
the truth. Justice sometimes drags its feet &#8211; or even collapses&nbsp;&#8211; when weighed down
by the chains of standard operating procedure, Laura. Lona would have disappeared.
Raeder would&#8217;ve covered his tracks. Your agency would&#8217;ve turned up its toes to the
daisies, and my good name would&#8217;ve been buried along with it&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s not <i>your </i>good name. <i>You</i> could&#8217;ve left&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It <i>is</i> my good name. In more ways than one. Do you think me so without conscience?
Do you think it wouldn&#8217;t affect me to know the name &#8216;Remington Steele&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; which
carries my face&nbsp;&#8211; had become synonymous with betrayal of the public&#8217;s trust? To know
you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d played you all along, or at the very least, left you to clean up the mess
behind me?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;ve no answer for that. I don&#8217;t really know you&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What do you imagine I&#8217;d have done if I&#8217;d left then? Hooked up with Daniel? Stolen
paintings with Felicia?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;They&#8217;d take you back&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He gave a humorless laugh. &#8220;They probably would. But other people are always
involved. There are supplies to be obtained, payoffs to be made, other players,
contacts, buyers and sellers and all their intermediaries. I&#8217;d have been

which side of the street I was working, or they would&#8217;ve viewed me as having stabbed
my colleague in her back&nbsp;&#8211; not the best card to come calling with&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Unless they thought it one big, long con.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele blew out a breath. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure some would be willing to believe that &#8211; though
I&#8217;ve never been made in quite so spectacular a way. And maybe after a long, long
time, I could&#8217;ve convinced myself of that too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then again, maybe not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In time, I
probably could&#8217;ve made proof again&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Proved my reliability.&#8221; He tilted his head and gave her a slight smile. &#8220;So, you believe
a tarnished Steele would&#8217;ve still been accepted back into the life.&#8221; He turned and again
took a few steps away from her before turning around to face her. He lifted his hand
out to the side, palm up, and swept it through the air from the top of his head down
toward his feet, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m here.&#8221; He walked back to her. &#8220;I stayed. Why?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8216;Do you think it wouldn&#8217;t affect me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?&#8217; his eyes asked her again. Had 'Remington
Steele' really seeped into his bones? Had <i>she</i> crawled under his skin? She desperately
searched her mind for another explanation, there had to be a <i>logical</i> explanation&nbsp;&#8211; she
found it. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have been free of Raeder if you&#8217;d left. You would&#8217;ve had to spend the
rest of your life looking over your shoulder &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes. I would&#8217;ve had to keep a profile so low life would&#8217;ve hardly been worth
living.&#8221; His eyes became distant, sad. He focused on her again, giving her an ironic
smile. &#8220;Give me the luxuries, I can do without the essentials.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, the only way to
be free of Raeder was to walk into the lion&#8217;s den and beard him. But the flaw in <i>this</i>
argument of yours, Miss Holt, is that I didn&#8217;t know until we were in the midst of our
sting that I wouldn&#8217;t have been free of Raeder if I&#8217;d left. I didn&#8217;t know Raeder had a
personal interest in seeing me take the fall and intended to pursue me to the ends of
the earth, if necessary&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Not now, not now. She couldn&#8217;t deal with this right now. &#8220;We&#8217;ve digressed.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He gave her a knowing smile. &#8220;So we have. Okay, back to my prevarication concerning
my plan that night. I was confident it would succeed. The only stumbling block
would&#8217;ve been if you&#8217;d vetoed it and prevented me from carrying it out. So I
minimized that possibility by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feeding you half-truths, lies by omission, and
outright falsehoods. I took it out of your hands.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He walked around the couch, flopped down onto it, and rubbed his face with his
hands. &#8220;Oh, this seemed so right at the time.&#8221; He patted the couch next to him, and
she accepted the invitation to sit. She knew from the subtle slackness of his
movements and posture, from the faint tremor of his hands when he&#8217;d raised them,
that the &#8216;discussion&#8217; was tiring him. Out of the hospital bed into her fire. Still,
something drove her on.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Promise me something.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He stiffened and eyed her guardedly. &#8220;If I can.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;When it&#8217;s my agency&#8217;s reputation, the name of &#8216;Remington Steele&#8217; that&#8217;s at stake,
don&#8217;t take it out of my hands. You have no right to do that. No matter how justified
you think you are.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He looked away. Finally, he nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;re right. My apologies. It won&#8217;t happen
again. You have my word.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And the word of Remington Steele is his bond.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And so is mine.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura sighed, turning to look at the filmy curtains across the room. They were drawn,
obscuring the balcony and the starry night that lay beyond. White curtains. Gray walls.
Gray chairs. White lamp. Black coffee table. Gray couch. Black and white and gray. The
color scheme of the apartment. Shades of gray dominated. To some, gray was a
neutral color. To others, a way of life. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me about Raeder&#8217;s stolen
art?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He ran a hand through his hair. &#8220;It was mostly suspicion. I was discreetly checking into
their provenance. Raeder&#8217;s a powerful man. I didn&#8217;t want to take the chance of
accusing him without being sure of my facts. Detective Chritz expedited matters in
that regard.&#8221; He grinned apologetically. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me to go
through legitimate channels.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;But you knew of the Monet.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I never saw it until that night we broke in, the night when the alarm went off. I
checked that panel right after you left to see if they&#8217;d hidden the mosaic in there &#8211;
that was the place I&#8217;d told you about, remember?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She nodded. &#8220;Something about it originally being built during Prohibition &#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Right. The Monet wasn&#8217;t there when I looked before, I swear.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I believe you.&#8221; She leaned against him. Sighing, they leaned back on the couch
together. &#8220;But you have one more thing to explain.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The $36,000 from Goldschmidt. You&#8217;ve been dodging that question long enough.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele dropped his head back on the couch and stared up at the ceiling. He was silent
a long moment. &#8220;I found his painting. The painting I&#8217;d been trying to recover for him
years ago.&#8216;The Portrait of Pastor Adrianus Tegularius,&#8217; by Frans Hals. I told him about
it Friday night. Goldschmidt obliged me by calling Raeder to insist Raeder personally
meet with one of Goldschmidt&#8217;s representatives. Immediately. With the painting in
hand. I don&#8217;t know what Goldschmidt threatened him with, but that was what lured
Raeder out of the mansion.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised Goldschmidt agreed to that. Putting himself in direct conflict with
Raeder&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Think of the painting&#8217;s history,&#8221; Steele said softly. &#8220;It was his father&#8217;s. Stolen by the
Nazis. Ending up with Raeder&nbsp;&#8211; not only a business rival, but the nephew of a grand
admiral in the Nazi fleet. A man who keeps an armoury flaunting Nazi memorabilia, a
man who, you told me, Goldschmidt suspects is funding neo-Nazis. I hoped
Goldschmidt wanted his painting badly enough, or resented Raeder enough, that he&#8217;d
consent to help me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele glanced at her. &#8220;To further fuel his resentment against Raeder, I also told him
Friday night about the other items I suspected were Nazi plunder. I told him we had a
chance to nail Raeder for it, thinking that&#8217;d make it even more likely he&#8217;d help me. For
whatever reason, he came through for me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Layer upon layer, Mr. Steele. When Goldschmidt called Raeder, Raeder had to have
suspected <i>you</i> told Goldschmidt about the Hals&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; He smiled slightly. &#8220;And just to make sure, I had Carl tell Lona that. That was
part of my plan for the night.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;So Raeder knew it was actually <i>you</i> luring him out of the mansion so you could make
your move on him when he returned, supposedly to rob him.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele nodded. &#8220;And he went along with it without hesitation, thinking he was the one
luring me&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;So he and Lona could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. finish you off.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Was Goldschmidt involved with Lona?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele shrugged slightly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I rather doubt it. We&#8217;ve only got the word of
some New York gossips and of a maid who never saw the man in question. Lona may
have been setting that situation up as well. And if the two of them <i>were</i> involved, who
was playing whom? I don&#8217;t know the truth of that situation. It&#8217;s all a bit too twisted for
me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I thought nothing was too twisted for you.&#8221; She held Steele&#8217;s eyes as he looked at her
uncertainly. She quirked her lips into a bit of a smile, and he gave a slight smile back.
She was kidding. Half-kidding. &#8220;And the $36,000 is your recovery fee for the
painting?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shook his head and widened his smile to a half-grin. &#8220;Believe it or not, Miss Holt, I
didn&#8217;t ask for it.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She gave a soft snort. &#8220;I <i>do </i>find that hard to believe. I&#8217;ve always pictured you wheelin&#8217;
and dealin&#8217; up until you drew your last breath.&#8221; Her grin vanished and she looked
away, swallowing hard, thinking of the Raeders and their plans for Steele. She turned
her head to look at him and found him gazing at her intently. His smile, too, had
disappeared. She touched him lightly to make sure he really was there.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele looked down at the spot where she had touched him, then into her eyes. &#8220;I
needed his help. His help in exchange for the return of his painting seemed a more
than equitable trade, given what was at stake.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">For a short time, she was lost in his gaze. She straightened&nbsp;&#8211; she wasn&#8217;t through with
her questions yet. &#8220;Why have you been avoiding telling me about Goldschmidt&#8217;s role
in this?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele shifted on the couch, hesitating before answering, looking away from her. &#8220;I
found Goldschmidt&#8217;s painting the night of the &#8216;thefts.&#8217; It was the one thing I knew
without a doubt was stolen. Raeder had hidden it in a display case with Admiral
Raeder&#8217;s dirk&nbsp;&#8211; so he could get to it easily and gloat over it, I imagine. Anyway, I didn&#8217;t
act on that knowledge until it served my purposes. I was caught up in other matters.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She put her hand to his face and turned it toward her. &#8220;Like being suspected of a
crime you didn&#8217;t commit. An understandable preoccupation.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He kissed her palm, then took her hand in his and gave it a squeeze before releasing
it. &#8220;So. Remington Steele is now a major donor to police departments and art theft
units, eh?&#8221; He affected a Cockney accent. &#8220;I fink me card at me ol&#8217; union&#8217;s bein'
pulled.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They both exhaled a laugh.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, there are two consolations.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;re they, Miss Holt?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;One is your newly redecorated apartment, your repaired suits, and a small
commission for a job well done.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mmm. And two?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The mayor&#8217;s having a media event for the occasion of your donations on Friday. You
get to have your picture taken shaking his hand on the steps of City Hall.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura tried to hide a smile as he perked up and sat a little straighter, adjusting his tie.
There was one thing&nbsp;&#8211; well, maybe two, but she wasn&#8217;t ready to go there yet&nbsp;&#8211; that
could seduce Steele from thoughts of fortune, and that was fame. Curious, for a man
whose previous existence was marked by total anonymity. &#8220;Yes. And you can display
your inimitable charm at the reception afterwards and win back the hearts of
Angelenos once more as &#8216;The Great Remington Steele.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Inimitable, eh?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Inimitable,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;And Bernice has been going crazy with calls and
telegrams from around the world congratulating you on the art recoveries. Reporters
from <i>Art World News, Art in America, Art Insight </i>&#8211; even <i>BBC News </i>&#8211; are all waiting to
interview you. Nurse Ratched&nbsp;&#8211; I mean, Rafferty&nbsp;&#8211; helped us keep them at bay while
you recovered in the hospital.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, my.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura couldn&#8217;t hold back her smile any longer. He&#8217;d been puffing up as she spoke.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He turned to her, narrowing his eyes. &#8220;Actually, Miss Holt, I think you were
withholding that information so you could use it to smooth over the fact you&#8217;re
depriving me of a couple million dollars.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What a suspicious mind you have, Mr. Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Hmmm. With good cause, I believe.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You still have the $36,000 from Goldschmidt.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Gone. Pfffffffffft.&#8221; He jerked his head from one side to the other.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What? Already? What did you do with it?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Gave most of it to Wallace&#8217;s Mission and Th&#151;&nbsp;, uh, a friend who helped me in my hour
of need.&#8221; As she raised her eyebrows at him, he jutted out his chin and frowned. &#8220;I
kept some of it for a new suit, made-to-measure, handmade, finest wool!&#8221; As she
stifled a laugh, he muttered, &#8220;Damn thing is, I can&#8217;t have it fit until I regain some
weight.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She reached out and pretend-straightened his tie.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Baron Leopold von Regelheim stood on the spacious grounds of his current home, an
eighteenth-century mansion. Across the road from him was his former home, the
abandoned Regelheim Castle. He stared at the old photo in his hand, a photo of some
British soldier in front of the castle, a photo inscribed &#8216;Regelheim, Northeim,&#8217; a photo
that had been used to trace the antique silver back to him. He ripped away the
wrapping from the silver and addressed the man who&#8217;d identified himself as &#8216;Weimar.&#8217;
&#8220;My mother, the refugees who had found a home with us, and my young wife had
to leave Regelheim Castle when the Nazis came. Later, the British occupied the castle.
This was stolen from us. It had been in our family for hundreds of years.&#8221; The baron
watched his wife, now no longer young, touch the antique silver with shaky fingers.
There were five plates, two water pitchers, several small pots and pans, a tray, and sixty-six pieces of cutlery. His wife lay her right hand open
on her breast, just above her heart. There were tears in her eyes.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The baron turned back to Weimar. &#8220;And you say he wants no money for this?&#8221; Weimar
shook his head. The baron&#8217;s voice trembled as he said, &#8220;It is astonishing he would

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura leaned back against the counter in Steele&#8217;s kitchen, sipping her wine, reflecting
on the previous day&#8217;s events. It&#8217;d been glorious. First had been the morning edition of
the <i>Los Angeles Tribune </i>&#8211; headlines of &#8216;Steele Gets His Man and His Monet!&#8217; and a
long article about the case, the donations Steele was making, and the Art Theft Unit.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As usual, he&#8217;d made quite a splash at the media event that followed. Every last vestige
of his previous negative publicity seemed to have been erased. The only slight glitch
came when he was supposed to hand over the check to the mayor. For the first time
that she could ever recall at such a public event, his smile looked somewhat forced.
Worse, the mayor practically had to pry the check from his hand.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">At the reception that followed, she saw him looking around the room, obviously
searching for someone. She was touched when, his gaze alighting upon her, he broke
into a huge grin and beckoned for her to join him. She&#8217;d raised her hands slightly in a
palms out position. He&#8217;d tilted his head to side, gave a bit of a frown, then smiled in
resignation. Seconds later he&#8217;d been whisked away by another rabble of reporters.
Yes, yesterday had been glorious.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura took another sip of her wine. She watched Steele&#8217;s hands as he stirred the pot
on the stove in the center island, an artist at work. Hands were not a feature she
usually noticed in a man, but his were beautiful. They looked like the hands of an
aristocrat, hands that had never seen a hard day&#8217;s work. She found it hard to reconcile
those hands with the story Daniel had told her of finding &#8216;Harry&#8217; on the streets. Of
course, Daniel had probably only told her that story to gain her sympathy. And what
was the significance of the gold pinky ring? He&#8217;d been wearing it the first time she
met him, when he was &#8216;Ben Pearson.&#8217; He&#8217;d worn it as &#8216;Johnny Todd.&#8217; Did he wear it
regardless of his identity? And if so, why? Even a little detail like that could blow his
cover. More questions he&#8217;d be unlikely to ever answer.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She tore her gaze from his hands and studied Steele critically. He looked a lot better
now, though still too thin. Well, he should get a good start on putting the weight back
on tonight. He was preparing another one of his gourmet feasts: bay scallop and
asparagus risotto layered with herbs, served with a salad with marinated tomatoes and
a drizzle of sweet basil vinaigrette.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The risotto smells good.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mmm. What pasta is to the south of Italy, risotto is to the north. Americans have
made it elegant and upscale, but basically,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; he grinned at her&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;it just makes you
feel good after you eat it. I got the rice in the Po Valley, from one of the mondine&nbsp;&#8211;
women labourers from the hills. Her boyfriend turned out to belong to a band of tomb
robbers.&#8221; Steele launched into a saga of how they&#8217;d tried to draw him into their illicit
activities. &#8220;I declined. Ghosts. I&#8217;m not good with ghosts.&#8221;</span></span></p>

tongue-in-cheek.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele paused reflectively. &#8220;The mondine lead terribly hard lives.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; He shot another
grin her way. &#8220;As immortalized in the film &#8216;Riso Amaro&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; &#8216;Bitter Rice&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; Silvana
Mangano, Doris Dowling, Vittorio Gassman, Raf Vallone. Lux Film.1949. A thief,
Walter, steals a precious necklace and entrusts it to his lover, Francesca, telling her to
flee to the rice fields and hide with the workers until he can safely meet her. She is
befriended by the voluptuous Silvana, who has discovered their secret. Not only does
Silvana want the necklace, she wants the magnetic, arrogant Walter, preferring him to
her good-hearted suitor, the soldier Marco. The four become involved in a plot
involving betrayal, love, and murder. Oh! the sultry, tempestuous Silvana, dancing in

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Only he would think expanding horizons meant watching old movies. Laura stole
another look at the counter to her left, trying not to drool. For dessert he was serving
a chocolate torte with chocolate ganache glaze. Chocolate. She hadn&#8217;t yet managed to
bring herself to tell him she really shouldn&#8217;t have it. Too bad he&#8217;d finished baking it
before she arrived, though. Her favorite part of watching him cook was when he bent
over to open the oven. Cute butt.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She glanced over at the coffee pot, smelling the aroma of fresh-ground beans. &#8220;I
thought you weren&#8217;t a coffee drinker.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s for you. I&#8217;ve never gotten into the coffee-drinking habit, especially at dinner. I

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh? What did he say?&#8221;</span></span></p>

good from evil, or making a good cup of coffee.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Let me have a taste.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He stopped stirring the risotto and poured her a cup.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She took a few sips. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve mastered the last.&#8221; She stared into her cup. &#8220;As for
the middle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from what I&#8217;ve observed, your compass seems pointed in the right
direction&nbsp;&#8211; plus or minus a few degrees of deviation.&#8221; She smiled in response to his
grin at her double meaning. &#8220;It&#8217;s your method of travel that&#8217;s a bit dubious at times.
And as for the first, well, you just made a start.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, how so?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You were honest about your dishonesty.&#8221; She shared his chuckle, shaking her head.
She set down her cup, turning serious. &#8220;Let&#8217;s give you more practice. Explain to me
about Carl. You&#8217;ve never given me the full story.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Practice makes perfect, eh?&#8221; He glanced at her as he added a bit more stock to the
risotto and stirred.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why did Carl suddenly become chummy with you on this job?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ah, another twist of the knife in both our hearts. I&#8217;m not sure if the Raeders
anticipated that or not, given Lona&#8217;s knowledge of us both, but it certainly played into
their hands. It was I who approached Carl. I thought we&#8217;d pair well on the project, him
designing, me finding the vulnerabilities, each building on what the other could do,
until we&#8217;d created a, a&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;A work of art?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele gave the pot another stir. &#8220;Something like that.&#8221; He faced her. &#8220;And I thought it
the perfect opportunity to get him to work with me again. I thought if we could just
work together, we could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mend the rift. He&#8217;s a good person.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Fortunately for you, in the end. How much did he know of what was going on?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Nothing of the set-up until the day before the party, the day Lora Raeder first put in
her appearance. She knew that the media would have a feeding frenzy once the thefts
had occurred, and that with all the publicity she might very well be recognized by
him. She&#8217;d had quite a bit of &#8216;work&#8217; done over the past year, but, well, they&#8217;d been
lovers, after all&nbsp;&#8211; right up until the time of Carl&#8217;s conversion. At least&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Carl had
been in love with <i>her</i>&nbsp;&#8211; she broke relations off when he converted, just as she&#8217;d done
with her father, according to Carl.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway, her voice, some mannerism,
something, could&#8217;ve given her away to him. That&#8217;s also, by the way, why they never
hung Lona&#8217;s portrait in the library until that day, so Carl wouldn&#8217;t recognize her from
that beforehand.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And <i>you</i> never recognized her?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shrugged. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t seen her for over ten years. She was a child&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Wait a minute. Wallace told Murphy you met in &#8217;79.&#8221;</span></span></p>

&#8221;</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura rolled her eyes. They should&#8217;ve known any friend of Steele&#8217;s would be about as
likely as him to give them a straight story when it came to his past.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Actually, I did see Wallace in &#8217;79. He didn&#8217;t talk about Lona much when I asked after
her. I thought there might be some trouble there, but I didn&#8217;t pry. I wonder now if his
story about having sent her off to college was just that. Or at least a bit of angling off
from the truth&nbsp;&#8211; it&#8217;s hard for me to imagine her completing college.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She joined him in a laugh of disbelief.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Given what you unearthed about her activities in recent years, I can understand why
Wallace would choose not to correct my misconception when we met again on the
Dillon case.&#8221; He shook his head. &#8220;She was a troubled child at twelve, but I never
dreamed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; His eyes unfocused as he lost himself in private thoughts.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He blinked and focused on her again. &#8220;Anyway, she couldn&#8217;t count on Carl not
recognizing her. And if he did recognize her, he would naturally suspect it was her
set-up. She had to make sure he wouldn&#8217;t give her away to me, so&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;She blackmailed him into silence, &#8221; Laura guessed.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele pointed the wooden spoon at her in agreement and turned back to the stove to
stir the pot. &#8220;Indeed she did. She told him she could implicate him in this as easily as
she could me, if she wished. And expose his past. She said she would, too, if he
somehow caused me to slip from their grasp. She suggested he take a nice little trip
out of the country for a while.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;But he could&#8217;ve exposed her past, too&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That she&#8217;d been married to old men and lived extravagantly at their expense, which
they didn&#8217;t seem to mind?&#8221; He shook his head. &#8220;I hardly think she worried about that.
No, Carl had much more to lose. He&#8217;s made a new life here. He has people he cares
about here. This is his home. He&#8217;s the guiding light of the Mission, a pillar of the
community. He&#8217;d lose everything he holds most dear. Raeder described Lona quite
accurately in saying she excelled at using one&#8217;s vulnerabilities against one.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele turned to her. &#8220;Laura, I know you were angry with me when I stopped Wallace&#8217;s
crew from speaking to you about Carl. I was quite certain Carl was not the thief. I
wanted to prevent you from finding out about our rift and all it entailed, since he
would seem to have a strong motive for setting me up. I feared that if you knew, your
desire to clear your agency, to clear the name of Remington Steele, might at some
point lead you to bringing Carl to the attention of the police; whereas as it stood, they
seemed quite happy to be focussing all their attention on me.&#8221; Steele hesitated a
moment before continuing. &#8220;There was more than just his recovery work that could&#8217;ve
been exposed. Carl grew up here, on the streets. Wallace rescued him from that. But
taking a boy out of the streets is one thing. Taking the streets out of that boy is quite
another. Carl made mistakes, serious mistakes, in his teens. I saw no good reason to
subject Carl to the possibility of having his present ruined by whatever the police
could uncover about his past. I knew you, me, one or both of us, could uncover the
truth without sacrificing him in the process.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And would one day <i>her</i> present be ruined by whatever was uncovered about <i>Steele&#8217;s</i>
past or by the pasts of his friends? He clearly wasn&#8217;t inclined to give up his loyalties to
them. Fire, Laura, you like playing with fire. &#8220;Why did you believe so strongly Carl
hadn&#8217;t set you up? The way he turned on you after Wallace&#8217;s death&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele gazed at her steadily. &#8220;Sometimes you don&#8217;t know why you believe in another,
when to all appearances that belief doesn&#8217;t seem warranted.&#8221; Steele put a hand to his
chest. &#8220;Sometimes you just know, deep inside, that the other person is worth that
belief,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; Steele smiled slightly &#8211; &#8220;although your faith in them may temporarily waver.
But, if the friendship can&#8217;t survive those ripples, it&#8217;s not worth having.&#8221; They held each
other's gaze, then Steele turned back to the stove and added just above a whisper,
&#8220;Besides, there&#8217;s always plan B.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura shook her head slightly. How easily he spoke of falling back to a &#8216;plan B,&#8217; of
discarding this life and assuming another. Or was she wrong about that? She watched
him as he stood at the stove, unmoving, staring at nothing. She thought back to the
words he&#8217;d been trying to tell her a couple of days ago in his apartment, the words
about why he hadn&#8217;t left, the words she hadn&#8217;t been quite willing to believe, the words
expressed in a typically British understatement that had been belied by his tone, &#8216;Do
you think it wouldn&#8217;t affect me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8217; Laura swallowed. &#8220;I, I can see your reasoning for
trying to protect him, but perhaps if you&#8217;d explained it, I would&#8217;ve seen it your way&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele started when she spoke. He gave another stir to the pot. &#8220;But perhaps not. I
know what your agency means to you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Carl should&#8217;ve come to you from the start, instead of leaving the country, leaving you
to your fate.&#8221; Her words came out sharper than she&#8217;d intended.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He glanced at her. &#8220;He came back, told me of her plot. And once I finally knew who
was behind it, I was able to do exactly as she&#8217;d feared&nbsp;&#8211; formulate a plan to clear
myself. With your help, of course.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura noticed he suddenly became very interested in stirring the risotto, clearly
knowing his initial less-than-forthright outlining of his plan to her was still a sore
point.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The spoon stopped its movement. &#8220;Lona was wrong. In the end what was important to
Carl was his principles.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Then why wouldn&#8217;t he help me when I went to see him?&#8221; Carl had purposely reacted
to those photos to deceive her. Not so shabby a trickster, after all.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Turning to her, Steele smiled slightly. &#8220;You made him feel quite guilty, you know. But
it was simply a matter of not knowing if he could trust you.&#8221; Laura grimaced, and
Steele&#8217;s smile widened. &#8220;He feared you&#8217;d thwart his plans. He was going to &#8216;right this
wrong&#8217; in his own way. He was merely misdirecting you.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Like any good con man.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He gave an acknowledging nod. &#8220;Touch&eacute;, Miss Holt.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura took a sip of her wine. &#8220;Who rigged the safe, do you know?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Probably Lona. She <i>is</i> the daughter of a first-rate burglar. It was probably child&#8217;s play
to her, literally. She also took Carl&#8217;s ring and gave it prominent display in the safe.
When I opened it, I thought Carl had played me false.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that was her intention.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He nodded. &#8220;It led to her downfall, though.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As Steele turned away and took a sip of wine from his glass by the stove, Laura had a
sudden thought. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the Raeders expose you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele choked on his drink. He grabbed a linen, dabbed at his mouth, and avoided
looking at her.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Damn it. He&#8217;s doing it again. She got impatient. &#8220;John Robie? Cat burglar?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Um. They know they&#8217;ve been bested by &#8216;The Great Remington Steele&#8217;?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She narrowed her eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;ve still got something big on them, don&#8217;t you? Something
that makes you feel safe. And that&#8217;s why Carl feels free to stick around, too&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura. How could you think such a thing?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She left her perch at the counter and circled around him, crowding him at the stove.
&#8220;You still haven&#8217;t told the police about <i>all</i> the stolen artwork, have you? You&#8217;ve got the
royal lavulite mosaic&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Risotto&#8217;s almost ready. It becomes glutinous if it sits.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Then we&#8217;re going to have a big soggy mess.&#8221; She grabbed his arm to force him to
look at her, letting go as he winced. She didn&#8217;t apologize. &#8220;Answer me.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He sighed. Turning to her, he said quietly, &#8220;Do you remember Raeder&#8217;s parting words
to me?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Mostly she remembered the thin lips curling into a smile that still made her shiver.
&#8220;&#8216;Auf Wiedersehen.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Precisely. &#8216;Until we see each other again.&#8217; The game isn&#8217;t over, in other words. I&#8217;ve
made a powerful enemy, Laura. And apparently, powerful friends. Or at least, I&#8217;ve
earned the protection of enemies of my enemy. Goldschmidt called just before you
came tonight. He told me he and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. others, all victims of Nazi pillaging, have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
taken care of the situation for me and Carl, that the balance of power has been
deposited into <i>his</i> account. He&#8217;s confident we&#8217;re in no danger. I didn&#8217;t press for
details. Of course there&#8217;s still Lona. She&#8217;d probably not go for a direct attack, though.
She&#8217;d lie in wait.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele bit his lip. &#8220;I apologize. I&#8217;ve been trying to think of the best way to broach the
subject tonight. Guess I was hoping I could get you plastered first.&#8221; His laugh came
out strangled. He started to reach out his hand to her but let it drop. &#8220;Laura, there are
no guarantees. Raeder is not a man who takes well to being bested. He&nbsp;&#8211; or Lona&nbsp;&#8211;
may still come after me. Expose your Remington Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He took a deep breath and let it out. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s best I&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She put a hand to his lips. &#8220;My Remington Steele never runs from a fight he didn&#8217;t
start.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He took her hand, kissed her fingers, and touched his lips to hers. &#8220;Then neither shall
mine.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As he turned to get an oven pad, Laura felt herself sag. Words from &#8216;Dark Victory&#8217;
came to her mind: &#8216;He didn't go away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It must mean something.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele removed the copper pan from the heat and beat in butter, a little olive oil,
Parmesan, and lemon zest. &#8220;Oh, the parsley.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She watched in puzzlement as he exited the kitchen. She went out into the dining
room only to see him return from the direction of the balcony, stalks of parsley in
hand.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;re growing it?&#8221; She asked in amazement, following him back into the kitchen.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He began to strip the leaves from the stalks. &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d give it a whirl. I&#8217;ve got a
little bush basil out there, too. I used it in the salad. I&#8217;ve, uh, even been thinking of
trying to grow a little cherry tomato plant. Nothing like homegrown tomatoes.&#8221; He
added the parsley leaves to the risotto and mixed them in.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;ve grown them before?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No. But I&#8217;ve eaten them.&#8221; He gave her a wink. He stirred vigorously, making the
risotto creamy and wavy&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;all&#8217;onda,&#8221; he informed her. &#8220;Would you bring the wine?&#8221; He
removed his apron and carried the pan into the dining room. They made a return trip
as Steele brought back heated shallow soup plates and she brought the salad.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele seated her along the long end of the table. Looking at the white dishes, black
cups, gray walls, she sighed. Gray. The color Murphy despised. &#8220;Murphy&#8217;s still
leaving.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele paused in putting his jacket on and adjusting his tie. &#8220;I tried talking to him,
telling him it wasn&#8217;t necessary&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;<span style="color: #ff0000"></span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I know. Thank you for that.&#8221; She touched his arm as he seated himself next to her.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He was merely protecting your interests.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;His bark was worse than his bite, you know.&#8221; At Steele&#8217;s wince, she touched his arm
again and smiled apologetically. &#8220;What I mean is, Murphy could&#8217;ve refused to take part
in the break-in at the Raeders, or in the laying of that last little trap for them. He
could&#8217;ve turned you in to the police either of those times. He even came to visit you at
the jail hospital and helped clean up your apartment.&#8221; And despite what he&#8217;d said,
Murphy had come to trust Steele&#8217;s intentions toward this agency&nbsp;&#8211; and her. Otherwise,
he wouldn&#8217;t have left. &#8216;No,&#8217; he&#8217;d protested, &#8216;I trust <i>you</i> to keep him in line.&#8217; Laura cast
her eyes down and picked up a fork, playing with it.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele leaned over and said softly, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I know he was your good friend.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She gave a small smile, putting a hand over his. &#8220;He&#8217;s still my good friend.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele nodded and cleared his throat. &#8220;Well, shall we try the risotto?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The risotto glistened with a transparent sauce and had a wonderful taste of grain&nbsp;&#8211;
tender, with just a slight firmness at its center. The meal passed in pleasant
conversation, filled with friendly laughter. Laura felt intensely aware of the man beside
her, as sensitized as the sandpapered fingers of a safecracker, registering each touch
of his elbow or foot as he shifted in his chair, each touch of his hand as he passed her
the salad, the risotto, or her wine glass.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">God, he was sexy. A man just didn&#8217;t have the right to look that good. But it wasn&#8217;t
only that. He was charming, intriguing, engaging&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. heart-robbing. And for each of
his virtues she could name ten of his faults. But not tonight, not tonight. Tonight, she
didn&#8217;t want to work on the puzzle that was him, the most complex one she&#8217;d ever
encountered, let alone the conundrum of why she was so drawn to him. Some things
just are. Tonight, she wanted to celebrate. Tonight, she wanted to indulge herself, and
he was an expert on indulgence. She smiled to herself.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ready for dessert? Coffee and torte?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, I really shouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221; At his hurt look she relented&nbsp;&#8211; not that she&#8217;d thought she
really could&#8217;ve declined. &#8220;I&#8217;d love some.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She helped him clear their plates and brought out the coffee as he began cutting them
generous slices of torte at the table. She moaned. She was in heaven. Three layers of
dark chocolate and almonds, the layers separated by a filling of milk and Gianduja
chocolates. The glazing was spread evenly over the top and sides, with more piped on
as a decorative edge. It was finished with a small rectangular bittersweet thin.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He pooled some red raspberry puree onto their dessert plates and set the slices on
top. Edible art.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s stunning.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Prepare yourself to be transported to the heights of ecstasy.&#8221; He sat back down next
her, put her plate in front of her, and picked up her fork. Turning toward her, he
smiled and rested his hand on the back of her chair, barely touching her, as he fed
her the first chocolatey bite.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh.&#8221; She closed her eyes. &#8220;Oh.&#8221; She should say something a little less monosyllabic.
&#8220;Oh.&#8221; She was hopeless.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She opened her eyes. He didn&#8217;t seem to mind her lack of eloquence. He sat there,
wearing a delighted smile, feeding her bites, absorbed in watching her chew. She ran
her tongue slowly over her lips, trying to extract every last essence of chocolate. He
brought his napkin to her mouth, dabbing at its corners. Surely those crumbs were
imaginary? She could&#8217;ve sworn she got them all. He slowly moved his head toward
hers.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She straightened. &#8220;I have a surprise.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You always do,&#8221; he said in a teasing voice, sitting back in his chair.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Finish your dessert.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was tryin&#8217; to do, Miss Holt.&#8221; Picking up his fork, his eyes lit with
amusement, he started in on his torte.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Thank God he never pushed. She was the aggressor, despite his occasional sexual
innuendo. She was the one who at unexpected moments literally seized him and
pulled him into a kiss. But much as her body screamed at her to follow through, she
never could. She&#8217;d told him many months ago, and despite what she&#8217;d told him at the
Federal Reserve Bank, she still worried. She&#8217;d get in too deep. He&#8217;d go. She&#8217;d be left.
In too deep. And whenever she&#8217;d think, just this time, just this time, it&#8217;d be alright
and it&#8217;ll all work out, her words would come back and haunt her. And she&#8217;d stop. And
he wouldn&#8217;t push. Sometimes she&#8217;d wish he&#8217;d push. But not really. Sometimes she
thought he purposely didn&#8217;t push because he knew that made her even&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. itchier,
and he was just waiting for her to go over the edge. No, that was uncalled for. He just
accepted what she gave him, honoring her body language while enjoying the
communication, never complaining about her seeming &#8216;hit on, then run&#8217; seduction
strategy.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She gave him a sidelong glance, heat flooding her body as it insisted on making
known its desires. Now <i>his</i> courting moves were like an orchestrated dance, never the
same but always with a gentlemanly flow, a gentle manly flow. How well he read her
moods. One time his approach would be a romantic slow waltz, the next a flirtatious
rhumba. He knew when it was time for a sensuous samba, a thrilling tango, a hot
salsa. And how would he be as a lover? He&#8217;d adapt to her responses, stopping when
she wanted to stop, going when she wanted to go, doing less when she wanted less,
more when she wanted&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;More?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What?&#8221; She dropped her fork.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He pointed at her plate. &#8220;Dessert. Do you want another piece?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No. Thank you. It was exquisite.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll wrap some up for you to take home.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Damn. She really was going to have to tell him about the chocolate. Next time. She
took his hand and led him to the couch. &#8220;Sit.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As he removed his jacket and loosened his tie and collar, she pulled out a few
carefully gift-wrapped items she&#8217;d hidden underneath the couch. Handing them to
him, she seated herself next to him.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">His eyes widened. &#8220;Thank you. What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Welcome home&#8217; presents.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, you shouldn&#8217;t have.&#8221; He tore into the biggest one as if afraid she&#8217;d agree.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Actually, that one&#8217;s not from me. I found it at your door.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They stared down at the book, &#8216;The Unicorn Tapestries.&#8217; Steele opened it to the
bookmarked page, featuring the last tapestry. The caption read: &#8216;&#8220;The Unicorn in
Captivity&#8221;: the unicorn, miraculously alive and whole again, lies chained to a circular
wooden gate in a lush garden, a happy pet, tamed by the maiden, enjoying the Garden
of Eden.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura ran a finger along the border of the page. &#8220;All I can see is a unicorn all tied up,
fenced in, on public display, wounded.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She glanced sideways at Steele and then turned her head to look at him more fully. His
face was frozen into an expressionless mask, his eyes distant. What was wrong? She
touched his hand. It felt like ice. As the long moment of silence continued, she put
her hand on his knee. Suddenly, like a spring uncoiling, he relaxed beside her.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He touched her hand and smiled. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Some say the wound is really just
the juice from the pomegranate tree he&#8217;s lying under, symbolizing rebirth.&#8221; He
shrugged. &#8220;Even if he&#8217;s truly wounded, he survives. And see? The chain isn&#8217;t sturdy,
the fence is low, and I think he rather enjoys the public attention. He could easily
escape if he wanted to.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why do you think he doesn&#8217;t try?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shrugged again. &#8220;He has the maiden for a companion, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he&#8217;s in paradise.&#8221;
Dropping his eyes, he cleared his throat and reached for the other gifts, setting the
book on the table before them. &#8220;Now, what have we here?&#8221; Giving her an excited grin,
he ripped the wrappings off the other ones as well, one after the other, like a child at
Christmas.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura tried not to wince. She&#8217;d have sworn he&#8217;d never gotten a present before. She&#8217;d
managed to re-use that wrapping paper through several occasions of gift-giving and
had been planning on asking him if she could have it back. Her annoyance faded as
she took a look at his face, lit with a thirty-two-teeth smile.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He fingered the videotapes in his hands. &#8220;Laura&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thank you. &#8216;Casablanca,&#8217;
&#8216;Gaslight,&#8217; &#8216;The Maltese Falcon&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I replaced them all. I just couldn&#8217;t lug them all up, not to mention stuff them under
your couch. You can carry the box up from my car, later.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; His eyes asked a question and she answered with hers. He leaned toward
her and gave her a kiss.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She broke it first, saying, &#8220;I have another one here. I thought we could rent a player
and watch it tonight.&#8221; She got up and retrieved it from under the couch as he set the
others on the table.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He grinned at her and once again tore the wrapping off. &#8220;&#8216;To Catch a Thief.&#8217;&#8221; He
chuckled. &#8220;Have you seen it?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve been too busy trying to catch one of my own.&#8221; She smiled.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He smiled in return. He put the tape with the others, turned to her, and took her hand
in one of his, moving close. He reached out with the other hand, gently brushed her
hair back off her shoulder, and lightly trailed his hand down her arm. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful
film.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There&#8217;s a scene, a classic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fireworks burstin&#8217; outside the window.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Frances Stevens, sittin&#8217; on the couch, tryin&#8217; to bait John Robie into revealin&#8217; his past . .
. seducin&#8217; him into a kiss. Perhaps we should re-enact it,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; he cupped her chin and
dropped a light kiss on one cheek&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;put us in the proper mood&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; he kissed the other
temple.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Irish. This time it was clear as a bell. That undertone to his speech was definitely Irish.
She put her hands on his shoulders and closed her eyes, sighing as he continued to
plant tiny kisses across her eyelids while leaning her back against the couch. The
kisses slowly trailed down her cheek, across her chin and up the other side. Oh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Soft,
warm kisses. Chocolate kisses. She could smell the chocolate on his breath. Chocolate.
So addicting. A forbidden pleasure. Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;morechocolatekissesplease.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is this how the scene goes?&#8221; she finally managed.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The action&#8217;s off-screen. I&#8217;m improvisin&#8217;.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She moaned as he folded about her, tangling his fingers in her hair, placing kisses
above and below her lips. She encircled his lean, willowy body with her arms, feeling
the beat of his heart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  it was fast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not too fast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feeling the heat of his body&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was hot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not too hot. A different kind of fever this time. &#8220;Fireworks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; She
lost her train of thought.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he whispered.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She felt him reach behind the couch cushions. His lips pulled into a grin. Puzzled, she
opened her eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to see him dangling a pair of purple plastic handcuffs, each
wristlet embossed with &#8216;Take Me, I&#8217;m Yours.&#8217; His blue eyes sparked mischief.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She laughed, shifted her weight, pressed him back against the couch, and covered his
mouth with her own.</span></span></p>
