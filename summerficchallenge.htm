Teacher, I apologize for turning in this homework late, but my dog ate
the original and I had to start from scratch.<br>
<br>
I chose Harry, who of course became Remington Steele. I didn’t quite
stick to the assigned format, but then again, Harry never could either.<br>
<br>
<p>Harry spent some time at High Jinx High School in
Enigma, Conn. How did Harry end
up there, you might ask? Well, Daniel sent Harry on "a year abroad" to
this high school.
Fifteen-year-old Harry was eager to go because he thought Daniel said
he was enrolling him in a
program called "A Year, A Broad." Harry was planning to decrease the
time interval between,
um, broads.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
Disservice Record:<br>
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Harry was Class President. His opponent
accused him of rigging the
election, but nothing was
ever proved.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">He was also elected King of Hearts. The
King of Hearts Dance is a
dance where the girl does the
asking. For the dance, the female student body elects a court
consisting only of males. From this
court, a duke, a prince, and a king are elected. Harry
actually got all three titles. In
fact, he was the entire court. All the boys accused him of rigging
these elections too, but not one
girl could be found who had voted for someone else.<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Sports Harry participated in:</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Track. Of course, Harry couldn't be
bothered to actually work out,
but he "owned" the Mad
Dash.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Gymnastics. Favorite apparatus was the
rings. The skills he
developed came in useful in his circus
days.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Dishonors Harry received:</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Harry earned perfect scores on his SAT's
and ACT's. The former tests
Safecracking, Aerial work,
and Theft; the latter tests Artifice, Chicanery, and Treachery.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">He also accumulated the most demerits in
the school. For this
achievement he was inducted into
the National Dishonor Society.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">He was selected by the faculty as one of
the eight students to serve
on the Academic Dishonesty
Council. (If a student was found not cheating on a test, he was hauled
in front of this council so
they could set him straight, er, crooked.)</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Clubs and Activities Harry participated in:</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">As you would expect of him, Harry was in
the following clubs:
Photography, Classical Movies
(founding member), Culinary, Dance, Equestrian. Also, he joined the
Debate Team to hone the
skills needed for the finer points of argumentation.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Perhaps surprisingly, he was not in the
Drama Club. He thought it
unnecessary since his life was
one big act.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">He joined the Wildlife Club but
immediately dropped out when he
found it had something to do
with animals of the four-legged variety.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p>Other clubs he participated in may need further explanation:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Art Guild. All visits to museums and
galleries were made in the
dead of night. Successfully
breaking into the buildings was as integral to the purpose of the guild
as was the appreciation of
fine art.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Key Club. No, not the organization whose
purpose is to provide
service, build character, and
develop leadership. This organization's purpose was to develop
lockpicking skills.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Strings Attached. This is a network of
peer helpers who tutor others
in the skills needed to be
successful in the underside of life.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">CIA. That's "Conmen in Action." Need I
say more?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Finally, Harry was voted least likely to find a good woman and
settle down. He was particularly
proud of this distinction.</p>
