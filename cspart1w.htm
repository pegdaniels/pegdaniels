<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">PART 1</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><a name="CS1"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Rubies are hot. Rubies are fire, blood, passion. Rubies live, pulse, throb. Rubies can
corrupt you, twist your soul, make you lose your way. A ruby is always the possessor,
never the possessed. It either loves you or hates you. If it hates you, it will destroy
you. But a ruby is treacherous&nbsp;&#8211; you never know how a ruby truly feels about you until
it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">A jeweller had told Steele this, and he believed it. &#8220;A ruby,&#8221; his old friend had added,
&#8220;is like a woman.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele eyed the ruby, now dangling so tantalizingly close. It was a deep, clear, &#8216;pigeon
blood&#8217; red, the most valuable. Over six carats. Of extremely rare quality, commanding
a price approaching $225,000 per carat. Few people realized that on a per-carat basis
the rarest, most valuable gemstones were these hot-blooded rubies, not the cold-as-ice diamonds.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Well, except for royal lavulite, of course.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">This was the most exquisite ruby to which Steele had ever had the chance to be up
close&nbsp;&#8211; and personal. It was hard, deciding whether he&#8217;d rather be examining the ruby
more closely or its wearer, this evening&#8217;s companion. Lora Raeder was in her early
twenties, a statuesque beauty, looking simply ravishing in a deceptively simple black
dress with a 24-karat gold clasp just below her right shoulder. Her fine blonde hair
was swept up atop her head, tendrils escaping fetchingly. Around her neck was a
delicate gold necklace, supporting the magnificent gem. She lightly
fingered the ruby with one hand while her other hand trailed languidly up and down
the front of Steele&#8217;s white dinner jacket, heightening his dilemma. Steele didn&#8217;t mind.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It did make paying attention to their conversation difficult, though. They were
discussing the Raeder Unicorn Tapestries, which hung in the Trophy Room of the
Raeder mansion: seven magnificent pieces, woven of threads of wool and silk, silver
and gold, replicating the series, &#8216;The Hunt of the Unicorn.&#8217; Unlike the originals, which
hung in The Cloisters at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and were woven about 1600,
these had been commissioned by Erich Raeder not quite a year ago. As each piece was
approximately twelve feet by twelve feet, the artisans must have worked feverishly to
complete them in time for the Raeders&#8217; move here.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You remind me of a unicorn,&#8221; she said to him. Her voice was low, sexy.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And she reminded him of a lioness on the prowl, with her catlike grace and her half-closed eyes of gold-flecked brown. &#8220;I hope you mean the embodiment of courtly
purity and perfection&nbsp;&#8211; and not the poor fellow portrayed in the tapestries,&#8221; he replied,
giving her an amused grin.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She swept her hand across his chest and shook her head slowly. &#8220;I mean that mythical
blue-eyed beast, too swift to be captured, too fierce to be tamed, too beautiful to be
forgotten, too mysterious to be understood.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He laughed quietly. What would Laura think of this characterization? He was afraid he
knew.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As another guest came to join them and claimed Ms. Raeder&#8217;s attention, he stole a
glance to the south. Earlier in the evening the view had been impressive&nbsp;&#8211; the expanse
of emerald green grass; the lush gardens awash in colour, butterflies flitting from
bloom to bloom; and in the background, across the basin, the hills above Culver City.
Now, it was too dark to make out much of anything, despite the illumination provided
on this side of the mansion by the floodlights on top of the roof.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">No matter. He had in mind a far lovelier view, another precious gem, someone who
shared many qualities of the ruby&nbsp;&#8211; definitely fire and passion&nbsp;&#8211; but kept them hidden
inside an exterior hard as diamond to penetrate. At least for him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Ah, there she was, on the other side of the pool, engaged in conversation with Ms.
Raeder&#8217;s husband and Murphy. Murphy looked ill at ease, of course, in his tuxedo.
Laura was attractively attired in a three-quarter length black satin sheath with straps,
a black gauze overlay, and an asymmetrical bottom hemline. It clung to her in all the
right places, emphasizing her small, lithe body, but hiding her dancer&#8217;s legs a little
too much for his taste.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Reluctantly, Steele tore his gaze from her and turned it to Erich Raeder. Sixty-five
years old, the man looked closer to fifty. He was tall, trim, powerfully-built, and
resplendently attired in a beautifully-tailored white dinner jacket. Steele felt a brief
stab of envy at the tailoring job, though he had no cause to complain about his own
finely cut suit.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Erich Raeder was a curious man. He was the nephew of Admiral Erich Raeder, grand
admiral of the German fleet under Hitler until Hitler, disillusioned with the
performance of the German navy, accused the admiral of incompetence and forced his
resignation. The younger Raeder, however, was interested in a different arena of
conquest, and no one would accuse him of incompetence. Considered ruthless and
brilliant, this Raeder was said to gobble up corporations&nbsp;&#8211; and men&nbsp;&#8211; for breakfast.
There wasn&#8217;t a shadow of emotion on Raeder&#8217;s thin, aristocratic face as he talked with
Miss Holt. Then again, in the weeks he&#8217;d been working with Raeder, Steele had come
to feel emotion was foreign to the man.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Now Miss Holt&#8217;s facial expression, that was a different story. Though he couldn&#8217;t
imagine Raeder could be saying anything of the slightest interest to her, Steele would
never know it. Even at this distance her dimpled smile lit up the place in a way that&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele started, and his attention snapped back to Ms. Raeder. Her hand had wandered
a bit low. He realized they were alone again. He tried to pick up her thread of
conversation.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&nbsp;&#8211; so fortunate for us Erich&#8217;s latest acquisition was Dillon Electronics. And we have
<i>you</i> to thank for that, in a way. If you hadn&#8217;t exposed Mrs. Dillon, the company
would&#8217;ve been run into the ground, and that galoot Meecham would&#8217;ve turned it into
an industrial park. An electronics company is so much more useful to Erich. He does
love his toys.&#8221; Her hand brushed his thigh. &#8220;And we got the added bonus of
discovering you, of engaging your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. services.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The Remington Steele Detective Agency does aim to please.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he does.&#8221; She ran her tongue over moist, sensuous, ruby-red lips.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele returned her seductive smile with one of his own. Though he&#8217;d only met Ms.
Raeder yesterday, he suspected she also gobbled up men<i> </i>for breakfast. Lord knows,
he had a weakness for beautiful, glamorous women&nbsp;&#8211; Ms. Raeder was simply the most
stunning woman he had ever encountered, and he had encountered quite a few&nbsp;&#8211; but
he was not naive. She was playing a game, had been playing one from the moment
they&#8217;d been introduced, with the looks, the touching, the innuendo. He willingly
played along. For now. Had this been another time, another place, another life, he
might have been tempted to carry it further.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I understand some tragedy occurred during your work on that case, though.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An
employee was murdered?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele&#8217;s throat tightened. His first real involvement in a case had led to tragedy.
Wallace. Murdered when he discovered Mrs. Dillon&#8217;s deceit. Wallace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He clenched
his hands, trying to suppress the anger he still felt whenever those memories
surfaced. Memories of that callous morgue attendant assuming Wallace was just a
junkie who&#8217;d OD&#8217;d. Memories of the attendant telling Laura if she wanted an autopsy,
get the stiff to her own pathologist.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He&#8217;d grabbed the man, made a pathetic attempt to summarize Wallace&#8217;s life in a few
short sentences: &#8216;That <i>stiff</i> once made twenty-seven straight passes in a crap game,
he had a daughter he put through college, he liked to fish off King's Point, and he
read the &#8220;Wizard of Id.&#8221; That <i>stiff</i> was my friend.&#8217; How could the essence of a man be
adequately described so briefly? It&#8217;d been nearly a year, and yet Steele still felt sick to
his stomach at these memories of his first introduction to the deadly side of his role as
Remington Steele.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He realized he hadn&#8217;t answered Ms. Raeder, who stood observing him in silence,
fingering his lapel. He unclenched his fists and let out a breath. &#8220;A friend, actually.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh.&#8221; She lifted a hand to his face and stroked him, but the mood had been lost. &#8220;Still,
I suppose you must get used to that in your line of work.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;One never gets used to the loss of a friend.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Just as she started to reply, the estate was plunged into darkness. The next moment,
the murmurs of the crowd were cut off by the unmistakable sound of an alarm
piercing the night.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><a name="CS2"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">With each passing moment, the crowd became more restive, impeding the progress of
the party of three trying to make its way to the pavilion from the farthest side of the
pool. Erich Raeder had commandeered Murphy&#8217;s penlight and taken the lead,
impatiently pushing at those too slow to get out of his way, occasionally muttering
something in German under his breath. Murphy followed in his wake, just behind
Laura, feeling like he was in a military parade march.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Finally, they were at the northwest end of the mansion, at the iron-gated entrance to
the pavilion. Murphy whispered to Laura, &#8220;Looks like they won&#8217;t be showing any first-run movie in here tonight after all. Bet Steele&#8217;ll be mad, huh partner?&#8221; Despite the
atmosphere of tension, they both snickered, Steele&#8217;s obsession with movies being an
endless source of amusement and exasperation.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They worked their way to the other side of the pavilion and entered the door to the
house proper, passing a security guard. They then went down the narrow corridor,
which ran south. The corridor opened into the Glass Room. This room opened to all
sides&nbsp;&#8211; each room on the main floor of the mansion was, in fact, connected to all its
neighbors. To the west lay the drawing room, and through its windows Murphy could
see the moonlight reflecting off the pool. To the south was the Jewelry Room, seldom
open to visitors, now locked tight. To the east lay their destination, the front hall.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As Raeder strode through the Glass Room, Murphy tried to keep up, but he and Laura
fell back, practically clinging to each other in an effort not to damage any of the
priceless works around them. Laura&#8217;s penlight barely pierced the darkness. Raeder&#8217;s
irritation at their slowness penetrated much further.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They exited the room and went down another corridor, their shoes clicking softly on
the black-and-white marble floor. Laura swept the penlight beam around the hall as
they moved. They were now midway down the hall. The penlight illuminated the white
marble columns that framed the grand stairwell and marked where the hall opened up
on the left to the main entrance to the mansion. Murphy turned to the left, noting how
Laura&#8217;s beam first caught the white marble staircase and then the imposing rock
crystal chandelier overhead, which split the beam into a thousand shards. Next to the
staircase was a marble-topped table. The command console, the heart of the alarm
system for the main floor, sat on it. But except for the panic button, the system had
been turned off on this floor for the party; otherwise, guests opening and closing
doors would set it off. In its stead, several guards, hand-picked from Raeders&#8217; security
division, had been patrolling the main floor. As effectively as any alarm system, these
muscular models of Aryan perfection had discouraged guests from exploring the
house proper.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Raeder pushed a button; the alarm was silenced. &#8220;Miss Holt, see to the main floor. This
alarm triggers a signal to my own monitoring agency, and they will alert my security
force. More men will arrive promptly. Direct them to me, upstairs. Mr. Michaels,
come.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy didn&#8217;t need to see her face to know his partner bristled beside him. He could
take Raeder&#8217;s imperiousness much more easily than Laura&nbsp;&#8211; she would take it as a
put-down of her competence. As she stalked off, he and Raeder moved to the stairs.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Where is Harald?&#8221; Raeder asked the guard in front of the stairway.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">"Er ist oben mit Herrn Steele, Herr Raeder."</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;s that about Mr. Steele?&#8221; Murphy asked.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He is upstairs.&#8221; Raeder turned back to the guard. &#8220;Are there any other guests in the
mansion?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Nein, Herr Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;See to the lights, Dieter.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Jawohl, Herr Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Raeder took the guard&#8217;s flashlight and handed Murphy&#8217;s penlight back to him as they
started climbing the stairs. On the upper landing stood a marble-topped table with
the command console for the upstairs system. They were met by another guard,
emerging from one of the bedrooms.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Where is Mr. Steele?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Er ist im Museum, Herr Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Go back downstairs, Harald.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Jawohl, Herr Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The rooms on the west side, from where the guard had come, either overlooked or
were fairly close to the scene of the party. Murphy and Mr. Raeder moved to the east
side of the floor, entirely occupied by the Museum Room, which housed Raeder&#8217;s
personal art collection, and by the Trophy Room adjoining it.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They crossed the stair hall and entered the museum side by side. Shining their
flashlight beams up and down the aisles, they made their way across the vast room.
Halfway, Murphy was startled by a sound coming from directly ahead, from the
balcony. Both he and Raeder flicked off their lights. Murphy saw a flashlight beam, and
then a figure, partially illuminated, entered the balcony door. As if by silent
agreement, Murphy and Raeder switched on their flashlights simultaneously, catching
the figure in the beams.</span></span></p>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy and Raeder strode towards him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What were you <i>doing</i> out there?&#8221; Murphy added a belated, &#8220;Sir.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele flicked his eyes towards Murphy, but kept his tone professional. &#8220;The door was
unlocked, Murphy. I was checking for an intruder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Did you see anyone, Mr. Steele?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele turned to Raeder. &#8220;No, but I haven&#8217;t checked out the museum proper.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Then let us do so and see if anything has been taken. Mr. Steele, see to the Trophy
Room.&#8221; Raeder pivoted and clipped off to the north side of the room.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele hesitated. Murphy frowned at him and went to the balcony door, which
overlooked a large, immaculately groomed kitchen garden. &#8220;No sign of forced entry.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Picked, no doubt.&#8221; Steele sighed and moved off to the south side of the room, noting
that Murphy stayed by the door.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Moving down the aisles, Steele used his torch to scan the exhibits around him. This
room had presented a delightful puzzle. Raeder had wanted him to vary the detection
and delay technologies used for the display cases, so that if an intruder somehow
managed to ferret out the secrets of one case, that knowledge couldn&#8217;t be used to
breach another. Ironic that Steele&#8217;s own expertise at breaking into such places to
relieve them of their riches should be applied to designing a system to prevent just
that kind of assault&nbsp;&#8211; except from him. He grinned.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He&#8217;d gotten quite creative in his designs but had had to temper some of them at
Raeder&#8217;s insistence: cost-effectiveness was not Steele&#8217;s strong point, and Raeder had
quashed a few of his flights of fancy in its name. Still, his designs were <i>ne plus ultra</i></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><i>.
</i>His and Carl&#8217;s designs, that is. Of course, as &#8216;Remington Steele&#8217; he&#8217;d taken all the
credit. But Carl&nbsp;&#8211; nearly as skilled as he in burglary and its accessory tasks such as
lockpicking and safecracking&nbsp;&#8211; had been indispensable. The two of them had had a
wicked good time on the project.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Weaving his way through the room, he passed paintings by old German masters from
the time of D&uuml;rer. Cranach, whose works were favoured by the Nazis, was particularly
well-represented. There was a van Gogh, a Matisse&nbsp;&#8211; both priceless. He passed by
exquisite inlaid furniture, rich Renaissance tapestries, sculptures, glass-paintings,
antique silver, arts and crafts from late Gothic to Renaissance times. Some items had
little plaques proclaiming them as having been acquired from the Sch&auml;fer collection of
Scloss Schweinfurt, or from the castle of the Prince and Princess Leopold of Bavaria, or
from the princely houses of L&ouml;wenstein or Hohenzollern&nbsp;&#8211; even a few from the last
Queen of Portugal, the last King of Bavaria.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Finally, he&#8217;d traversed the room and was at the entrance to the Trophy Room on the
southwest side of the museum. He supposed he had to go in there. He wished he
could think of a good excuse to have Murphy or Raeder go in there instead. He wished
the lights were on. He wished Ms. Raeder hadn&#8217;t just compared him to a unicorn.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shook himself, gave an uneasy laugh. Sometimes he could be so superstitious. He
shined his torch into the Trophy Room. The layout of this room was bizarre. Raeder
had erected a long corridor that wound clear back to the east wall of the mansion, and
then to the south, to the mansion wall there, before entering into the Trophy Room
proper. Along one side of the corridor hung the Unicorn Tapestries. But, although
wider than normal, the corridor was not wide enough to give a proper perspective to
the tapestries even in normal light.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele entered the corridor, and in the eerie glow of his torch, he felt the walls closing
in on him. With each step he increased his pace. Tapestry dogs&nbsp;&#8211; greyhounds in front,
chasing by sight; running hounds in back, chasing by scent&nbsp;&#8211; and hunters, with ugly,
cruel faces, bore down on him and the unicorn. Finally, at nearly full sprint, he
rounded the last corner, but not with relief.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The room he now entered repulsed him, out of place amidst the artistry of the rest of
the mansion: an armoury of historical military and hunting weaponry, at three
thousand artifacts one of the largest private collections in the world. Raeder boasted
that a number of the weapons were spoils of war, captured by members of his own
family. As Steele played his torch about the room, it picked out one of Raeder&#8217;s prize
possessions, an &#8216;Honour Pattern&#8217; Naval dirk, awarded by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder
to some &#8216;deserving&#8217; U-boat captain, or naval hero, or retiring admiral. The Damascus
blade had been specially hand-forged, but its pommel was literally its crowning glory<span style="text-decoration: underline"></span>.
The brass pommel&#8217;s design included an eagle on which was set a swastika with
seventeen rose-cut, individually-set diamonds, four in each swastika leg and the last
one in the centre. Quite beautiful indeed, if one could only forget the symbol on which
they were mounted.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Most bizarre were the other displays in the room: the stuffed bodies of animals Raeder
had hunted and slaughtered. As Steele swept his torch around the room, a grizzly
bear, a leopard, a lion, a rhino, a cougar, a cape buffalo, a wild boar, each leapt at him
to tear him to pieces.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He shook his head. Such blood lust displayed amidst exquisite art. This sight had
given him a whole new perspective on the rest of Raeder&#8217;s collection&nbsp;&#8211; combining this
sight, the dubious provenance</span></span>

</script>
<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"> of some of the art pieces, and Raeder&#8217;s predilection
for conquest in the business world, he couldn&#8217;t help but think that each art piece
must also somehow represent some sort of vanquishment.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As he turned to go, the glare of his penlight again caught the dirk. Odd. The half-metre cube display case looked different. Holding his penlight in his teeth, he felt
around the under edges of the display case. Unlike the rest of his treasures, Raeder
wanted the dirk easy to get at, so there was this little trick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He heard the click and
carefully opened the case. Taking the penlight in hand, he inspected the interior. It
looked as if someone had inserted a small, thin rectangular object between the casing
and the black velvet cloth that covered it&nbsp;&#8211; only someone as intimately familiar with
this case as he was would ever notice it. He reached behind the dirk, cautiously lifted
the cloth&nbsp;&#8211; and nearly dropped the torch in surprise. Talk about dubious provenance&nbsp;&#8211;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mr. Steele. We have a problem.&#8221; The cultured voice, only betraying its Germanic origin
by the pronunciation of the &#8216;w&#8217; with a slight &#8216;v&#8217; sound and by its stilted formality,
carried through the walls even into this cavernous room.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The lights overhead came back on. Steele sighed with relief. He tucked the velvet back
and closed the case, then threaded his way through the exhibits and jogged through
the corridor, studiously avoiding looking at the tapestries. He entered the Museum
Room and headed towards the central aisle.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Raeder and Murphy stood midway down the northern section of the museum; a
number of Raeder&#8217;s security men were now scattered throughout the room. Murphy
was inspecting an opened display case and the area surrounding it, making sketches
and diagrams in a small notebook, not touching anything&nbsp;&#8211; &#8216;securing the area and
observing it carefully.&#8217; Good old standard-operating-procedure Murphy.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele knew which exhibit they surrounded. &#8220;The mosaic was taken.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">As he joined them, Murphy eyed him. &#8220;You know the placement of every object in this
room?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Of course not, Murphy,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; just most of them&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes. An intricate mosaic of
amber and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. royal lavulite.&#8221; He ignored Murphy&#8217;s sharp look.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;A gem that intrigues you, does it not, Mr. Steele?&#8221; Steele did look up at that. &#8220;I believe
the first case you ever became personally involved in concerned royal lavulite,&#8221; Raeder
continued.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Yes, the first &#8216;case.&#8217; He&#8217;d come to Los Angeles to steal gems of royal lavulite and had
ended up instead assuming the identity of Remington Steele. &#8220;That&#8217;s true, Mr. Raeder.
I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;d know that.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You should not be, Mr. Steele. I would not be who I am without thoroughly checking
out everyone with whom I do business. Especially if it is someone I intend to employ.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They looked up as Harald came rushing back in. &#8220;Entschuldigen Sie bitte, Herr Raeder.
Es betrifft ihre Gattin. Etwas ist geschehen.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele took off running, hearing Murphy&#8217;s confused &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and then
footsteps pounding after him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><a name="CS3"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">A wide empty circle surrounded Laura and Ms. Raeder. On the circumference of the
circle, various elegantly dressed guests were down on their hands and knees, crawling
around the pool area. Laura was making sketches and diagrams of the area on some
cocktail napkins. Ms. Raeder was in obvious distress, sobbing.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura looked up to see Steele and Murphy trying to navigate the crowd, finally
succeeding and cautiously entering the circle. &#8220;Ms. Raeder, Miss Holt. What&#8217;s wrong?
What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; Steele asked.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ms. Raeder&#8217;s necklace. It&#8217;s gone.&#8221; Laura could hear the tension in her own voice and
chided herself for her unprofessionalism.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, my. Are you sure the chain didn&#8217;t simply break? Perhaps it&#8217;s around here
somewhere, on the ground.&#8221; Steele gestured vaguely around him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura nodded toward the other guests. &#8220;That&#8217;s why all these people are crawling
around, Mr. Steele. But Ms. Raeder says she hasn&#8217;t moved from this spot. I&#8217;ve already
searched inside this circle.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;But who could&#8217;ve taken it? How?&#8221; Steele asked.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to determine, <i>sir.&#8221;</i> Again, she couldn&#8217;t keep the tension out
of her voice. &#8220;Ms. Raeder says you were the one closest to her. That you caught her
when she stumbled in the darkness.&#8221; She saw a glint of suspicion flare in Murphy&#8217;s
eyes, no doubt mirroring her own. No, Murphy had more than a glint. A conflagration.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Something struck the back of my knees, causing me to stumble,&#8221; Ms. Raeder offered
tearfully.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele turned to Ms. Raeder and touched her arm. &#8220;Yes, well, I assure you, Ms. Raeder,
the Remington Steele Agency will give the matter its full attention. We will unearth the
culprit responsible.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You can count on it.&#8221; Laura&#8217;s words were directed to Ms. Raeder, but her pointed
gaze was upon Steele.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><a name="CS4"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Myriad reasons could be given why many guests had already scattered, leaving as
soon as they could after the alarm went off and before the police arrived: they thought
it none of their business, or they feared the publicity, or they didn&#8217;t want to be
inconvenienced by the questioning, or, worse, by having to appear in court.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Or they had something to hide.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele&#8217;s voice came clearly from inside the library, where the police were interviewing
him. Laura stared at the library door. Interviewing? Who was she kidding? It was an
interrogation. An interrogation of the man who would not reveal even his own name.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The library door opened. She started toward it, then stopped in disappointment as a
detective came out instead of the person she&#8217;d hoped for.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Miss Holt, I want to verify some information with you.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Of course, Detective&nbsp;&#8211; ?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Russell. Mr. Steele was hired to design and oversee the installation of the Raeders&#8217;
interior security system six weeks ago, correct?&#8221; Well, that was the official version,
though Laura knew some of Wallace&#8217;s crew had helped with the design. She nodded. &#8220;I
have here that Mr. Steele hired a crew of men from the Lost and Found Mission to do
the actual installation.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Interesting.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Detective?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Russell looked up from his notes. &#8220;Interesting how men of such obvious expertise all
flocked to the same Mission.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s heart missed a beat. She&#8217;d queried Steele during the Dillon case about the
competence of Wallace&#8217;s crew in setting up a security system. The words he&#8217;d spoken
at that time came back to her: &#8216;Between them they've over seventy-five years of
experience.&#8217; What he&#8217;d left unsaid she&#8217;d nevertheless understood&nbsp;&#8211; that experience
was in burgling. Oh, why had she let Steele do this job unsupervised? She feigned
confidence. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been using them for nearly a year, Detective. They&#8217;ve done
excellent work for us.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;So, Mr. Steele spent six weeks out here&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Six weeks going over every inch of the house and grounds&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&nbsp;&#8211; and the last three of those weeks the crew was also here.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Doing God knows what. Laura wasn&#8217;t sure if the insinuations were actually there or if
she heard them in the detective&#8217;s voice because of her own fears. At any rate, there
was nothing she could refute.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Now, tonight,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; the detective flipped to the next page of his notes, and Laura steeled
herself&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;the power went out and the alarm went off shortly after that.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s correct, Detective Russell.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele finished his tale of the evening&#8217;s events, then responded to the questions put
by Detective Kearney for clarifications and more details. When Kearney could wring
nothing new from him, Kearney thanked him. As Steele turned to leave, Kearney said,
&#8220;Mr. Steele, let me just go over the high points again.&#8221; Steele nodded. These Beverly
Hills coppers were much more polite than most of those he&#8217;d dealt with before&nbsp;&#8211;
especially those from his &#8216;pre-Steele&#8217; days&nbsp;&#8211; but beneath Kearney&#8217;s veneer, Steele
discerned an intelligence and street sense conceivably as keen as his own. Great. Just
what he needed&nbsp;&#8211; a &#8216;Lieutenant Columbo&#8217; on his tail. Kearney looked up from his
notes. &#8220;You were standing next to Ms. Raeder when the power went out.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Ms. Raeder stumbled, and you caught her.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I caught her, yes.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Do you know what caused her to stumble?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8216;Did Steele hook his leg around her?&#8217; was really the question swimming below the
surface of Kearney&#8217;s mind, but there was no point in Steele letting show he knew this.
&#8220;Ms. Raeder said something struck the back of her knees.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Kearney gave him the once-over, then continued. &#8220;After she stumbled, you took off to
the Museum Room.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;To investigate the alarm.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And you went out onto the balcony why?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I found the door unlocked&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Your associate discovered an amber-and-royal lavulite mosaic had been stolen from
the Museum Room. And Ms. Raeder discovered that the ruby necklace worth over a
million dollars had been taken right off her neck.&#8221; Prosaically put, but Steele
recognized the bait; he didn&#8217;t take it. After another swift look-over, Kearney
continued. &#8220;Mr. Raeder and Mr. Michaels say that after the theft of the mosaic was
discovered, you took off running.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Provocative phrasing, that. He looked Kearney in the eye&nbsp;&#8211; always look &#8217;em in the eye,
Daniel had taught him. &#8220;The guard came in. He said something had happened to Ms.
Raeder&nbsp;&#8211; I understand German a little. I headed towards&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Mr. Steele, I&#8217;d like to ask you to submit to a search.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele couldn&#8217;t help but admire Kearney. This man would keep him on his toes.</span></span></p>


<br>

<br>
<p><a name="CS5"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Perps knew their stuff.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura stopped pacing in the front hall, her thoughts on the crime scene interrupted by
the portly Beverly Hills police detective who bowled in from the east side of the
mansion. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Removed the electric meter to cut the electricity to the house. Safer, better, than
cutting wiring. Cut the power from the garage, made the easy climb to the balcony
above, bingo! Whoever planned this knew the house, knew the security set-up, knew
how to break into the display case.&#8221; For the first time, the man faced her; in contrast
to the little piggy eyes she&#8217;d expected, he had cold eyes, shark eyes. She could see
him smelling for blood as he added, &#8220;And knew how to get close to Ms. Raeder.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She kept her face impassive. &#8220;Have you found the necklace or the mosaic?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Not yet, ma&#8217;am. But we will, we will.&#8221; His flat expression belied the politeness of his
voice as he left her with a &#8220;Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura glanced at Murphy, who was speaking to his police photographer friend, then
turned back toward the library door as Steele walked out between two officers. He still
wore a confident look, still held himself in his usual proud, stately manner. Still in full
Steele mode. They stepped into the front hall, obviously heading toward the door.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Oh, no. &#8220;Where are you taking him?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;To the hospital,&#8221; Kearney replied.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The hospital?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Internal search, x-rays, the whole nine yards.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Are you arresting him?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She was about to protest further when Steele said in a firm voice, &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,
Miss Holt. I&#8217;ve agreed.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She wished he hadn&#8217;t. Not only did it limit the range of his defense in later
proceedings should he be arrested, but even if he only wanted to show them he had
nothing to hide, what he might consider insignificant&nbsp;&#8211; a piece of paper with a
telephone number, a receipt&nbsp;&#8211; might be incriminating evidence in the hands of the
police. Funny, she would&#8217;ve thought he would&#8217;ve known things like this. Maybe he
did. Who knew how his mind worked?</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She watched as they led him outside, her impotence making her feel caged. She
wished she could inspect the premises further, or question the hosts and remaining
guests, or at least leave so she could start mapping out her strategy on this case, but
the police would allow none of that at this time: like any PI, she wasn&#8217;t welcome at an
active crime scene, and they wanted to interview her again.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She started pacing east down the hall, her feet on automatic pilot. She stopped cold
when she realized she&#8217;d gone through the Porcelain Foyer, turned into the Dining
Room, and was now at the entrance to the Breakfast Room. On the opposite side of
the room, the bay window gave a view of the Lunar Garden. Normally, such a sublime
sight would&#8217;ve filled her with peace. But now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now it brought back memories that
warred with her worries that she&#8217;d made a terrible mistake in allowing a man skilled in
chicanery and art theft to be her frontman, let alone in putting him in charge of the
security of the Raeders&#8217; riches. She gave a hollow laugh. She&#8217;d made a mistake? She
must&#8217;ve been insane.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She crossed the room and stared out the window. Was it only a few days ago that, with
permission from Mr. Raeder, Steele had taken her for an evening stroll there?</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They&#8217;d wandered through the garden, their fingers occasionally brushing, neither of
them bold enough to take the other&#8217;s hand. Somehow, Steele had arranged for the
main pathways to be lit by candles in crystal holders set atop ceramic tiles. A
sensuous, romantic fragrance had filled the late-summer night.</span></span></p>


<br>

<br>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; Steele reached out to touch one of the eight-foot tall shrubs filled with
thousands of tiny, green-yellow flowers expressing a sweet, hypnotic perfume.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Night-blooming jasmine&nbsp;&#8211; Queen of the Night.&#8221; Laura reached out to touch it herself.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele grinned at her. &#8220;You can almost feel the scent in the air.&#8221; He moved on to some
small trees filled with flowers, yellow and peach and pink and gold and white, hanging
like bells, tropical and decadent, adding their intoxicating odor to the blend. He
turned to her, lifting an eyebrow.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s Brugmansia&nbsp;&#8211; Angel&#8217;s Trumpet.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Aptly named.&#8221; He bent to sniff a three-foot bush. Every one of its huge flowers,
double purple with white centers, their edges rolling back to form tendrils, pointed
upwards. &#8220;These are fruity.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s a type of Datura. It&#8217;s called Purple Devil&#8217;s Trumpet.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He gave her a sly grin. &#8220;Ah, angels and devils, eh? They mix surprisingly well with each
other, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; Without waiting for her answer, he strode over to a trellis
filled with vines. &#8220;I know these. Moonflower&nbsp;&#8211; the &#8216;no-light flower.&#8217;&#8221; The magical, pure
white blossoms with their flat faces luminescing in the dark and their leaves shaped
like hearts were headily fragrant.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I can teach you all about flowers, Mr. Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Suddenly, he was standing in front of her, hardly any distance at all between them,
looking down at her. &#8220;I&#8217;m only interested in one. A rose. It&#8217;s called an &#8216;American
Beauty.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It comes with thorns, Mr. Steele.&#8221; She put her hands on his shoulders.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Her awareness of the other sensual delights surrounding them was obliterated when
Steele led her off the pathway and, under the blanket of darkness, took her in his
arms and kissed her&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>

<br>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy opened the door to the Breakfast Room and noted how Laura tensed as he
entered. That damn con man. How could he do this to her? She&#8217;d finally turned a
corner with the guy and decided to move their relationship to a more personal one,
and now it turned out that all along he&#8217;d just been waiting for his chance to pull off
something big. Dammit, even he himself had finally gotten to the point where he&#8217;d
looked upon the guy&#8217;s continued presence as a commitment of sorts. But this guy had
waited them out, gained their trust as never before, and seized the first opportunity to
pull off a heist.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura glanced back at him, but then resumed looking out of the window. &#8220;How could
they get through his security system so easily?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He set it up so he could get at the mosaic&nbsp;&#8211; a mosaic of <i>royal lavulite</i>.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She turned quickly toward him. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t do that, Murphy.&#8221; But uncertainty
flickered over her features.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">For her sake, Murphy tried to rein in his anger. &#8220;What&#8217;s your theory, then?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;An accomplice cut the power, then the thief &#8216;stumbled&#8217; into Ms. Raeder and snatched
the necklace&nbsp;&#8211; the chain was thin, easily snapped. Ms. Raeder&#8217;s attention was diverted
from it by her fall. The accomplice stole the mosaic.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy shook his head. She was always trying to excuse the guy. Well, this was just
too long a string of coincidences. &#8220;Think about it, Laura. Why did the alarm go off?
Anyone with the skill to get the mosaic out of the display case that quickly and
without setting off its individual alarms has the skills to not set off the main alarm.
And the thief with the ruby could&#8217;ve just slipped out in the confusion created by the
power outage alone&nbsp;&#8211; his absence would&#8217;ve never been noticed. But not if that thief
was &#8216;The Great Remington Steele.&#8217; For him, the alarm <i>would have </i>to go off, so he
could <i>investigate,</i> so he could slip off to the Museum Room, pick up the mosaic, and
pass it and the ruby to his partner.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Murphy&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;We <i>know</i> he has a special interest in royal lavulite. It&#8217;s simply back to business as
usual. <i>He</i> couldn&#8217;t resist. Especially since he failed before to steal the royal lavulite we
were guarding&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Murphy&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It all fits, C and D.&#8221; Cut and Dried. C and D, E and F, U and D. How long had it been
since he&#8217;d shared that private lingo with Laura? It&#8217;d been replaced by a stupid code
consisting of movie synopses, complete with annotations. Murphy went to stand
before her to drive his point home. &#8220;He sucker-punched us, Laura.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She shivered. &#8220;Murphy&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The door opened, and Jenkins, the rotund detective who&#8217;d spoken to Laura earlier,
poked his head through. &#8220;Soon as a door or window was unlocked or opened, alarm
would go off, right?&#8221; He held a doorlock in a plastic bag, no doubt taken from the
balcony door. Laura nodded. &#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll check this baby out, see if it&#8217;s been picked.
Not that it matters much. Luckiest thing if it wasn&#8217;t picked. Then the thief would have
to be someone who was already in the house&nbsp;&#8211; he swiped the necklace, then the
mosaic, opened the door, and tossed &#8217;em to his accomplice. &#8217;Course, I don&#8217;t think the
thief&#8217;s that stupid. Most likely he picked it himself, just to throw off our scent.&#8221; As a
seeming afterthought, he added, &#8220;Found a pick on Mr. Steele during our little search,
ya know.&#8221; He eyed them both as if trying to decide if they were food capture, then
nodded and left.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s mouth tightened. &#8220;There&#8217;s something about that man that makes me want to
punch him right in his fat, jowly face.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy swung his fist, hitting the door. He saw Fred&#8217;s startled look in the rear view
mirror but knew the driver was too discreet to ever make mention of what went on in
this limo&nbsp;&#8211; Laura, and especially Steele, would make sure anyone privy to their more
private goings on could keep secrets. He leaned his head from side to side, then
brought it forward and back, trying to ease the tension in his neck muscles. He stared
out the window. It wasn&#8217;t often he rode in the limo alone. Hell, it wasn&#8217;t often he rode
in the limo at all&nbsp;&#8211; too pretentious. But Steele had proclaimed Laura&#8217;s Rabbit &#8216;most
unsuitable&#8217; for the occasion and that no employee of the agency bearing &#8216;his&#8217; name
should be seen coming to the party wallowing in Murphy&#8217;s Lincoln, so the three of
them had come in the limo. Now with Steele being taken by the police to be searched
at the hospital and Laura planning to run off after him in a taxi as soon as she&#8217;d
finished up at the Raeders, Murphy was left to himself in this symbol of snobbery, so
relished by Steele.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Suddenly, he had to get out of this car. &#8220;Pull over, Fred.&#8221; He refrained from slamming
the door and strode down the sidewalk, not caring where he was, not seeing any
passersby. Damn it, why had he ever let his guard down? Laura would never blame
him, but he should've known better. He <i>did</i> know better. He knew how con men
operated. Lord, hadn&#8217;t he had enough personal experience with them during his
career?</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Pivotal events during his college years had first put him on their scent. As soon as he
could after graduating, he&#8217;d become a freelance PI, even traveled around the U.S. with
a bounty hunter who specialized in con men. They&#8217;d dealt with block hustlers,
shortchangers, pastors of persuasion, fraudulent telemarketers, door-to-door dupers,
pyramid schemers, and glamour scammers. Oh, yes, Murphy knew all about con men.
He&#8217;d once thought he&#8217;d devote his entire career to apprehending them.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It hadn&#8217;t quite worked out that way. The realities of the life he&#8217;d been leading had
worn him down. He&#8217;d gotten tired of living in motel rooms, tired of eating at roadside
diners, tired of never knowing where his next paycheck was coming from, tired of the
air of sleaze surrounding bounty-hunting. He&#8217;d returned to California, done a brief
stint at a small detective agency run by a judge, and then hit the big time with a job at
the Havenhurst Detective Agency. There he&#8217;d met the remarkable Laura Holt. When
she formed Remington Steele Investigations, it&#8217;d been an honor and a privilege to be
asked by her to be her partner. He&#8217;d expanded his focus, helping her bring to justice
many different kinds of characters, from the dregs of society to corporation slime.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And then <i>he</i> had oozed in. It&#8217;d been like a knife twisting in Murphy&#8217;s gut to see Laura,
this special lady, fall under the con man&#8217;s charms from the very beginning. Murphy
had kept thinking she&#8217;d surely see how wrong this was professionally, and how in her
personal life she certainly deserved better than this glitzy fraud. Scratch his surface,
and there was just a con man.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But if anything, she&#8217;d become more and more taken with him, though she&#8217;d fought it
in herself and tried to hide it. Probably the only one she&#8217;d hid it from with any success
was the con man himself, which had been just fine with Murphy since he&#8217;d figured the
guy would get bored and move on. And then Murphy would pick up the pieces and
show Laura that his quiet, true, steadfast love for her was there for the taking&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy turned and whacked the building he was walking by. Why couldn&#8217;t the guy
have just gotten bored and moved on? How could that damn con man have used Laura
like this? Murphy could kick himself. He&#8217;d gone soft, not voiced his objections strongly
enough in the beginning when he&#8217;d had his best chance. And despite his continued
wariness, he&#8217;d always kept his objections toned down&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d wanted Laura&#8217;s
perceptions of the man&#8217;s basic decency to be correct, because of what she wanted for
her agency. Most unforgivably, he&#8217;d allowed his <i>own</i> perceptions to be blunted by her
continued support of the man.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He, with all his knowledge and experience of the tricks used by con men, had been
had yet again. He, who should've known better, had forgotten a basic axiom: once a
con man, always a con man.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy pulled up short, then turned around and noticed Fred had been following him
a discreet distance away. He got back in the car and stared out the window. &#8220;Home,
Fred.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy leaned over and put his head in his hands. He, who wanted her happiness
above all else, had failed Laura.</span></span></p>

<p><a name="CS5.25"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Jack Ritt was at the National Art Library. Several years ago, he&#8217;d made a &#163;20,000
donation to the N.A.L. supporting cataloguing in the archives. He&#8217;d followed that
donation with an application for a reader&#8217;s ticket to the archives: he&#8217;d confessed he
thought of himself as an amateur art historian. He&#8217;d given a Dr. John Bunker, M.D., as
a reference. When the N.A.L. wrote to Dr. Bunker for a referral, Jack wrote back,
&#8216;Professor Ritt is a man of integrity,&#8217; and signed the letter, &#8216;Dr. John Bunker.&#8217; Since
then, he&#8217;d continued making large, annual donations for cataloguing. After all, he had
a vested interest.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Jack knew the most likely time that he&#8217;d be alone with the manuscripts. He was alone
now. He took out from the stacks a 1955 catalogue for an exhibition at the Ohana
Gallery of London, a place that had closed in the mid &#8217;70's. He placed the catalogue in
a museum bag and slipped it out of the building. He then drove north out of London
to his home in Golders Green.</span></span></p>

the ocean. The air was quite damp now, and he was shrouded in mist, but he didn&#8217;t
mind. That was the way he liked it. He closed his eyes, the better to feel the breeze
and hear the slap of the water. He inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the salt air.
The only thing missing was a certain beautiful woman. Well, not tonight, or rather, this
morning. This wasn&#8217;t the kind of meeting to which she was invited. He opened his
eyes and checked his watch. Almost 2:00. He turned around and looked up at Pacific
Park&#8217;s nine-story-high Ferris wheel, the world's first solar-powered Ferris wheel, now
motionless. He began to make his way towards the merry-go-round. He wished he&#8217;d
brought Laura out here sometime when the park was open. She liked cotton candy</span></span>

Here she could&#8217;ve had cotton candy, popcorn, ice cream, and hot dogs. They would&#8217;ve
been surrounded by stilt walkers, face painters, and clowns. She certainly would&#8217;ve
wanted to try her hand at the so-called games of skill. He&#8217;d heard this park billed its
games as &#8216;authentic carnival games with prizes.&#8217; If that was true, at least a quarter of
the ones on the midway were rigged and most of the prizes were trash. Well, it
would&#8217;ve been fun to point out to her all the cons going on, as long as she took it all
in stride and didn&#8217;t try to have everyone busted.</span></span></p>

she probably liked roller coasters best of all, the more stomach-lurching, the better.
And bumper cars. She liked to drive aggressively and probably would&#8217;ve enjoyed
nothing more than caroming off him. Yes, Laura and her driving. He smiled,
remembering how she&#8217;d careened down the roads of the wine country when Wilson

he remembered her look of pain after confronting Wilson. All those years, she&#8217;d kept
that pain of Wilson leaving her inside herself all those years. He hadn&#8217;t meant to
eavesdrop on her and Wilson when she&#8217;d laid bare her soul&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d just been at the
wrong place at the wrong time. Still, it&#8217;d seemed to be a cathartic moment; she&#8217;d
seem to come to an acceptance of her past with Wilson. No, much more than that,

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;First it was stolen from the Schwarzburg Castle in Germany. Then, somehow, it ended
up in Long Island, of all places, as a gift to a priest. He gave it as a gift to a nun who
was an art teacher. The nun brought it to a furniture restorer to have the frame
repaired. The restorer recognized the painting might be valuable, and when the nun
came to pick up the frame, he told her all he wanted for payment was the picture&nbsp;&#8211;
that he saw the eyes of Christ in the picture. Of course, that won the nun over. She
gave it to him, having no idea of its real value.&#8221;</span></span></p>

him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">John consciously kept his lip from curling. He&#8217;d had in mind snorkelling, flirting,
playing tennis, flirting, windsurfing, flirting, horseback riding, flirting, parasailing,
flirting, nightclubbing, flirting, seeing stage shows, flirting&nbsp;&#8211; flirting, flirting, flirting&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Pottery&#8217;s also big here. They specialize in whale designs.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, this just gets better and better. Any fine eating establishments?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Emerald Dining Room&#8217; and &#8216;By the Sea Caf&eacute;.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">No classically elegant French fare, no traditional roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, no piquant Indian curry, no authentic Tuscan pasta, no fish chowder with sherry peppers and black rum,  no Calypsonians to entertain him, no Dixieland group with brunch, no pianists and harpists and classical trios to accompany his afternoon tea, no band to provide a lively beat for a dinner dance&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;Don&#8217;t suppose the former is encrusted with real emeralds, is
it?&#8221; As Wallace started looking like he was finally cuing in on John&#8217;s undertones, John
made an effort to rein himself in. It wasn&#8217;t Wallace&#8217;s fault, after all, that John had
jumped to the wrong conclusion. However, there was one last question he needed to
ask, and he wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the answer. &#8220;And our accommodations?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;We gotta a choice between Budgell&#8217;s Motel and Windamere Cabins.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">When Wallace continued to stare at him with a chagrined look on his face, John finally
realized he was standing there with his mouth open. He closed his mouth. He refused
to think any further about the lap of luxury accommodations he&#8217;d been looking
forward to. &#8220;Uh, I&#8217;ll leave it in your expert hands.&#8221; Was he going to end up sleeping on
the flea-ridden mattress or on the hard wooden floor?</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace tilted his head. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t what you expected, right?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Of course it is&nbsp;&#8211; no, not really.&#8221; John gave a little shrug.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I should&#8217;ve known. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll drive you back to Port Aux Basque.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Yes, there he could catch the Super Ferry back to North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and then
he could&nbsp;&#8211; he looked at Wallace&#8217;s crestfallen face. &#8220;No. Don&#8217;t be ridiculous. I&#8217;m looking
forward to this.&#8221; John plastered a big smile on his face. He didn&#8217;t have a reputation as
a consummate con artist for nothing. Besides, he didn&#8217;t often avail himself of casual
comradeship, and it&#8217;d been three years since he&#8217;d last seen Wallace; it could be an
interesting experience.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t pack the right clothes for the trip.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Uh, probably not. Unless linen trousers and casually elegant cottons by day and jacket
and tie in the evening are <i>de rigeur </i>here.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace finally relaxed and laughed. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you think we were going?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;King&#8217;s Point in Bermuda. I thought you&#8217;d just planned some obscure route for getting
there to make sure no one was on our tail for the Carnavalet job.&#8221; John smiled ruefully.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace laughed and clapped him on the back. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drive you to Springdale so you can
shop for clothes. The highest temperature here won&#8217;t even reach the lowest of
Bermuda.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Oh, lovely. &#8220;Any other details about this place you care to share to further elevate my
gay mood?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace laughed again, shook his head, opened the passenger door of the car, and
ushered John in with a sweeping gesture, finishing off with a little bow. John chuckled.
He&#8217;d have to plot some appropriate way to pay Wallace back for this.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">In Springdale, John settled for some denims, some cotton trousers, some plain cotton
shirts, a pair of boots, sneakers, a light sweater, a jacket, and, at Wallace&#8217;s insistence,
a floppy cotton hat to keep the sun off his face when Wallace took him fishing. &#8220;We
could&#8217;ve gone deep-sea fishing in Bermuda,&#8221; he muttered under his breath. He gave
Wallace a sweet smile when Wallace shot a look his way.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Windamere Cabins turned out to consist of four pine log cottages nestled together at
the foot of some hills. The cabin had two bedrooms, double bed in each; a full
bathroom, towels included; a kitchen with stove and refrigerator, dishes and pots
included; and a living area with cable TV. John wondered if they could get a movie
channel.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">After he resigned himself to his fate, he found King&#8217;s Point and Rattling Brook, a
thriving metropolis of less than one hundred and fifty souls and where the cabins
were actually located, did have their good points. The cottages overlooked the deep
green waters of the ocean. An eagle lookout was right behind them. They were in
scenic coastal lowlands of a big valley surrounded by beautiful, high mountains.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The next day Wallace decided they should go hiking. John&#8217;s protests that his scaling of
museum walls in Paris had been more than enough exercise for the week fell on deaf
ears.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s only four or five miles, John.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Two hours later, John felt compelled to point out, &#8220;You neglected to tell me these four
or five miles are straight up and down.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace only laughed at him. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a thousand-foot climb all total, John. Carl told
me about the time you two climbed up to Isola 2000 in record time.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes, well, that was a ski resort, there were ladies waiting for us at the top, we had
Mediterranean sun and Alpine snow to look forward to, there was a variety of French
and Italian restaurants on the mountain, there was cross country skiing, freestyle
skiing, night skiing, an outdoor ice rink, a heated swimming pool, game rooms, night
clubs, and a cinema,&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; John paused to catch a breath&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;and the only reason we got
out of the bus at Isola and climbed the rest of the way to Isola 2000 was because the
driver was a loony old codger who took the hairpin curves at dizzying speeds, cackled
ever time he made one, and would shout out in French, &#8216;Once again, death has been
defeated.&#8217;&#8221; John stopped to take in a lungful of air and looked up at the steep
mountainside to North Ridge. &#8220;We must&#8217;ve climbed hundreds of these wooden steps.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Eight hundred and eighty by the time we&#8217;re through.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be a cripple tomorrow.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;By the way you moan about this, one would never know you&#8217;re someone who
regularly climbs mountains, fords streams&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You forgot &#8216;follows every rainbow&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;til you find your dream&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Or the jewels, or the artwork&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Or whatever else you&#8217;re commissioned to find.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I live to serve.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I think you&#8217;d rather live to be served.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I would, but no one&#8217;s applied for the position yet.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Actually, I think you&#8217;d soon be bored with such a life, John.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to give it an extended trial period.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Lord, look at this.&#8221; Wallace set down his pack on the wooden lookout at the top of the
ridge. They got the full view of Corner Brook Gorge, the steep granite walls nearly
vertical. Even though it was late May, they could still see ice far below them. Wallace
pointed off into the distance. &#8220;You can make out some of the landmarks of King&#8217;s
Point itself. There&#8217;s Corner Brook. There&#8217;s Bulley&#8217;s Pond. There&#8217;s Bulley&#8217;s Mish.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Mish&#8217;?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s what Newfoundlanders call a marsh&nbsp;&#8211; it&#8217;s actually a large peat bog. There&#8217;s
Moose Barrens&nbsp;&#8211; see that rough ground over there covered by Caribou moss and
dotted with scrub spruce and juniper? Once, in the dead of night, I actually saw a
young bull moose in the middle of the road around here. I just stopped and watched.&#8221;
After gazing awhile longer, Wallace shouldered his pack again. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re almost to
the highest part of the trail.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, joy.&#8221; But John grinned when Wallace turned to look at him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace snorted and shook his head. &#8220;Good thing you weren&#8217;t this smart-alecky five
years ago. I&#8217;d never have taken you on.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Five years? Has it really been that long?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It was &#8217;71, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes, I believe that&#8217;s right.&#8221; When he was about eighteen, just after his ignominious
return from South America, where Barney had suckered him out of his then-meagre
lifesavings. Barney had come across him in a street brawl and had taught him how to
box proper. They&#8217;d travelled from town to town hauling in the cash because he, &#8216;The
Kilkenny Kid, Pride of the Pampas,&#8217; looked more like &#8216;Skinny Kid, Available for
Pounding,&#8217; and the locals all bet against him. In the end, Barney had convinced him he
was a good enough boxer to make it in America. &#8216;The Kid&#8217; had given his every last
centavos to Barney so Barney could buy them tickets, and that had been the last he&#8217;d
seen of Barney. That night he&#8217;d ended up in one of Rio&#8217;s extremely violent and poor
neighbourhoods, and a nightmare of being sucked back into that kind of life had
scared the hell out of him. Just wanting to get away as fast as he could, he&#8217;d
swallowed his pride, rung up Daniel, and asked if Daniel would spot him a ticket back
to London. Daniel had never asked him what had happened, and &#8216;Harry,&#8217; as he was
known to Daniel, had never volunteered the information. &#8220;South America led to good
things after all.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;South America?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Right before I met you, I was in South America. In my travels, I heard rumours about
how the Nazis who&#8217;d relocated there had brought with them looted gold, jewellery,
and art work&nbsp;&#8211; even Monets and Picassos. When I got back to London, I started
thinking about the possibility of recovering such items, but decided I first needed
advanced training in, uh&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Burglary. So you found me.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You&#8217;re the best.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace only laughed at that. &#8220;You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s added all the &#8216;artistic
refinements.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I can only break into the systems. You know enough that you could actually build
them.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace shrugged. &#8220;Hobby. Carl&#8217;s picked up on that though&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;s getting better than
me at it. But, breaking into the systems is all you need in this business.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why&#8217;d you never let me and Carl work together with you back then?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You two greenhorns? Gimme a break. Besides, I didn&#8217;t want you intimidating Carl.
You pick things up so damn fast.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">John shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;m a couple years older than him&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And that was another reason. Talk about hero worship.&#8221; They both laughed. &#8220;But
seriously, you have to remember, I&#8217;d just taken him into my home about then. He
needed my undivided attention. He was pretty wild.&#8221; After a pause, Wallace added
softly, &#8220;He&#8217;s still too volatile, too easily set off by things beyond his control. Too eager
to seek revenge against anyone he thinks wronged him.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, the streets can do that to you. You certainly saved him from a nasty existence.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace threw a grin at him. &#8220;Speaking from experience, John?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;It must&#8217;ve been hard on your daughter, having a boy only four years older than her
suddenly move in with you.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace&#8217;s voice turned sombre. &#8220;Well, soon after that her mother finally decided she&#8217;d
had enough of the business trips to Europe I was always taking&nbsp;&#8211; she never knew the
line of work I&#8217;m in. She divorced me, took Noley with her. Haven&#8217;t seen my girl since
&#8217;72.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;She&#8217;ll be ready for college in a few years, though. I&#8217;ve already saved enough to put
her through.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whew, that was a hot climb.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Why do they call this &#8216;Haypook&#8217;?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;The locals decided this hill looked like a hay stack, also called a &#8216;hay pook.&#8217;&#8221; They
shed their jackets and stood on Haypook Summit, taking in another breathtaking view.
The land fell away steeply on all sides except in the direction they&#8217;d approached from.
Taking a panoramic view, they could see the Southwest Arm of Green Bay, coastal
islands, jumbles of hills, rocky barrens and peaks, boreal forests, lakes, ponds, rapids,
and waterfalls. In some directions, their view was unimpeded for nearly eighty
kilometres.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t say this hasn&#8217;t been worth it.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I admit, it&#8217;s a lovely view.&#8221; John glanced over at Wallace, saw the man&#8217;s eyes shining
with pleasure.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Thank you for coming with me, John.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Thank you for inviting me.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Later that night, having turned down Wallace&#8217;s invitation to teach him fly-fishing by
moonlight, John filled up the bath to nearly overflowing with water as hot as he could
bear while pouring in nearly a box of Epsom salts, adding some lime juice, and tossing
in a small muslin bag filled with slices of ginger. He climbed into the bath and
kneaded his calves, wishing he were being given an Exotic Lime and Ginger Salt Glow
with Well-Being Massage by a scantily clad Bermudan masseuse. He soaked in the
blissful waters until his body flamed red and his fingertips shrivelled to white, then
prepared to retire for the night. He turned down the covers, crawled into bed, and&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">at the ungodly hour of 5:00 the next morning, Wallace roused him from a dream in
which he&#8217;d just accepted an invitation from a lovely lady to stroll down a pink beach in
Bermuda. &#8220;The fish are biting, John.&#8221; &#8216;Bully for them&#8217; was the first response to come to
mind, but instead he dressed and gamely accompanied Wallace onto the lake in an old
motorboat. His nose slathered in zinc oxide, SPF 35 sunblock covering every other
possibly exposed inch of his body, and his floppy hat pulled low over his face, he
promptly fell asleep. He awoke a little later to find Wallace pulling in a large trout.
Wallace waved away his apology for having fallen asleep. &#8220;An eighteen-pounder,&#8221;
Wallace told him. &#8220;Jigging gets them every time.&#8221; John wondered how he&#8217;d managed to
sleep through a jig being done in a little boat. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re going to do a little trolling.&#8221;
John nodded sagely, and as they moved through the water at about 2.5 kph, promptly
fell asleep again, only to wake up to Wallace pulling in another large trout. He finally
managed to stay awake for the next go round and caught some little fish that Wallace
made him throw back. They eventually finished their expedition with what would&#8217;ve
been a score of 5 - 0, but Wallace threw the last three of his back, saying he had no
need of more now and could always catch more later. John couldn&#8217;t quite see the point
of sitting on hard boat seats for hours for the brief thrill of catching a fish when one
was going to turn right around and toss it back. For all he knew, the last three fish
were all the same fish, conning Wallace into believing he was a man of great skill, and
he told Wallace so. Wallace laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re the one who likes telling fish stories.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">John decided to make up for his own lack of fishermen&#8217;s skills. He went grocery
shopping, cleaned the fish, stuffed them with mussels, then grilled them, Potatoes
Anna, and carrots. These he served with a Caesar-like salad&nbsp;&#8211; he had to substitute
boring iceberg lettuce for the romaine&nbsp;&#8211;  and a Newfoundland molasses pudding for
dessert, recipe courtesy of the cabin owners. If he&#8217;d had his way, he would&#8217;ve started
out with peach-and-brie canapes, but apparently brie was not in great demand among
the locals. Wallace declared the meal superb, and John thought it did taste quite good,
but then again, he&#8217;d found out while hiking on the trail that even peanut butter
crackers tasted divine.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The next morning, he again woke with the sun. He thought he heard Wallace out in
the living area, but no tap came at his door, so he fell back to sleep. He got up at 7:00
to find Wallace chuckling away, lying on his bed reading &#8216;Every Man is Innocent Until
Proven Broke, a Wizard of Id Book.&#8217; The title reminded John of the definition of British
justice he&#8217;d heard as a child, &#8216;Every man is innocent until proven Irish.&#8217;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">John made them a simple breakfast of tea, omelettes, and toast with a jam that tasted
a bit like honey and apricots, but which was made from Newfoundland cloudberries.
&#8220;Ready for me to take you back to Port Aux Basque?&#8221; Wallace asked him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Had he offended Wallace?</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so stricken. It&#8217;s nothing you&#8217;ve said or done. In fact, I give you credit. I
would&#8217;ve had to peel Carl off the ceiling by now.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">John relaxed and laughed. &#8220;You brought Carl out here?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I made that mistake once. It was like dragging a four-year-old child to see the
dentist.&#8221; They both laughed. &#8220;Anyway, this is supposed to be fun.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I <i>have</i> enjoyed myself,&#8221; John said sincerely.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Wallace smiled at him. &#8220;But enough is enough. Go get your things. Don&#8217;t worry about
me, I enjoy being up here by myself for a while.&#8221; John nodded and tried not to display
too much alacrity in his step as he went to pack.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It was another three years until he saw Wallace again, and Wallace had gone through a
lot of changes. For a while he&#8217;d simply disappeared off the face of the earth&nbsp;&#8211; not even
Carl had known what&#8217;d happened&nbsp;&#8211; and they&#8217;d all assumed the worst. When Wallace
returned, he told a tale of how he&#8217;d wrestled with demons and almost lost, cast into a
personal hell of alcohol and drugs. He said he&#8217;d only been rescued through the grace
of Jesus Christ. John was surprised&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d never seen any signs of Wallace
overdrinking, let alone using drugs&nbsp;&#8211; but he didn&#8217;t pry. Someone who didn&#8217;t talk about
his own past was hardly in the position to ask about another&#8217;s. He&#8217;d just been glad to
have his friend back alive and, apparently, happy.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">It&#8217;d been another three years until he, as &#8216;Remington Steele,&#8217; had seen Wallace again.
The skilled fisherman had become an equally skilled fisher of men&#8217;s souls. At least he
had been, until Steele had hired him for a job that had cost him his life.</span></span></p>


<br>

<br>

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele swallowed hard. He stood up on the pier, took one last look down into the
water, then turned to go&nbsp;&#8211; he had other business to attend to. Just before leaving
Pacific Park, he paused at a stand that read &#8216;Cotton Candy.&#8217;</span></span></p>

Room and disarmed a display case. She saw him caress that mosaic. The pieces of
amber ranged from black through red and gold to green and from near translucence
to milky opacity, and the pieces of royal lavulite&nbsp;&#8211; she watched his long, slender
fingers fondle the stunning, vibrantly colored violet gems, a lover reunited with his
beloved&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">That single word, whispered in the distinctive accent that bespoke London and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
something else, drew her consciousness up from the depths of the dream. She sat up,
startled.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;re you doin&#8217; here?&#8221; Still whispering, Steele moved to turn on the lamp by the
couch.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She stared at him groggily, too disoriented to remember the perfectly logical reason
she&#8217;d had for coming.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">After doing what she could at the Raeders&#8217; and undergoing another interview, or
rather, interrogation, by the police, she&#8217;d gone to the hospital, hoping to bring Steele
home. But they&#8217;d already taken him back to the police station and wouldn&#8217;t let her see
him; they&#8217;d told her not to bother waiting for him&nbsp;&#8211; he&#8217;d be there awhile. At least they
hadn&#8217;t found the ruby on him&nbsp;&#8211; or in him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She&#8217;d returned to her house, made up her initial to-do list for this case, then finally,
exhausted, climbed into bed. But she&#8217;d been too restless to sleep and had ended up
getting into the Rabbit and driving to his apartment. She&#8217;d taken the sleeping bag
from his closet, left his bedroom door open in case he snuck in without waking her,
and fallen asleep on the couch, inhaling the faint scent of him that lingered in the
bag&#8217;s material. As she&#8217;d slipped from wakefulness the memory of the other time she&#8217;d
been in this bag&nbsp;&#8211; spooning him, flanked by a circle of gold-crazed cutthroats</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&nbsp;&#8211; had
segued into a dream. The cutthroats had turned into police officers. They&#8217;d torn Steele
out of her grasp, pummelled secrets out of him, led him off in chains. Headlines had
flashed: &#8216;Remington Steele Investigations Goes Down the Toilet.&#8217;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele had moved around the couch and now sat beside her, watching her.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What time is it?&#8221; She tried to see her watch.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;About five.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;They&#8217;ve had you there all this time?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Yes. Thorough, our men in blue.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;But you weren&#8217;t under arrest. You could&#8217;ve left any time.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Remington Steele&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t. Besides, if they think I&#8217;m holdin&#8217; back on &#8217;em, they
might get a little too curious and start diggin&#8217; a little too deeply into &#8216;Remington
Steele&#8217;s &#8217; past. So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;The best defense is a good offense&#8217;?&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Sun Tzu?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Vince Lombardi, I think.&#8221; She noted his blank expression. &#8220;A football coach.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh. At any rate, well spoken, Miss Holt.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She still felt uneasy that he was speaking to the police when he didn&#8217;t have to, but
once he got it into his mind something was &#8216;right&#8217; or &#8216;not right&#8217; for &#8216;Remington
Steele,&#8217; it was next to impossible to dissuade him from it. Now, if she could only be
sure he had it in his mind that as the man the public identified as &#8216;Remington Steele,&#8217;
it was &#8216;not right&#8217; for him to steal million dollar rubies. She furrowed up her brow and
ran her hand over her face&nbsp;&#8211; there was something wrong with that last thought, but
right now she was too tired to figure it out.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What&#8217;s our next move?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What? Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Get with the program, Laura. She got off the couch and paced the
short distance to his dining room and back a few times. She always thought better
when she was pacing. Finally, her head felt clearer. She turned professional, speaking
as if giving a report. &#8220;I completed my initial examination of the scene. Murphy is
buddies with the police photographer, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get copies of his photos.
We&#8217;ve made sketches and diagrams of the pool area and the area around the museum
display case. Before I left, I was able to get some witness statements from the few
remaining guests who were willing&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Your night sounds worse than mine,&#8221; Steele teased with a slight smile.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She tried, unsuccessfully, to hide a small smile of her own. He&#8217;d probably prefer being
tortured on the rack to doing routine investigative tasks. She turned her smile into a
smirk. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d say we were each engaged in our favorite activities. You were dodging
questions, I was finding answers.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Touch&eacute;.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She returned to the business at hand, ticking off the points on her fingers as she
continued to pace. &#8220;We need to interview all the guests and the help, see if anyone
saw anyone else close to you and Ms. Raeder, someone who could&#8217;ve caused her to
stumble into you. And we need to interview Ms. Raeder ourselves.&#8221; Noticing he
seemed about to speak, she went on hurriedly, &#8220;Murphy and I will handle all this, Mr.
Steele.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And what do <i>I</i> do durin&#8217; &#8216;all this&#8217;?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She paused, trying to find the right way to put it, but he spoke before she&#8217;d found it.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I see. I do what I do best, of course. Sit back and let you professionals handle the job,
eh?&#8221; He got up, walked to the fireplace, and stood facing away from her, gazing out
the sloping windows that ran from floor to ceiling, hands in his pockets.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She returned to sitting on his couch. &#8220;Mr. Steele. There are simply no other suspects
at this point. It would be best, for your own sake, not to involve yourself.&#8221; She rubbed
her forehead with her hand, staring at his stiff back. Then she straightened up. It was
time she got to the real reason she&#8217;d come. No doubt they&#8217;d tried to put him through
the wringer at the police station, but she needed to ask the questions herself&nbsp;&#8211; more
was at stake than ever before. &#8220;Near the time of the theft, did you see anyone else
close to where you and Ms. Raeder were standing, or feel anyone else close to you
when the power went out?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I apologize, Laura. Ms. Raeder was doin&#8217; a bang-up job at keepin&#8217; my attention solely
on her.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The frustrations of last evening, eased in no way by the image Steele&#8217;s words conjured
up, boiled over into her words. &#8220;And your security system is so poor someone broke
through it this easily? And just happened to target a mosaic of royal lavulite?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;<i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t have gotten through the safeguards that quickly.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;You could&#8217;ve set it up so you could.&#8221; Did his shoulders just tense? &#8220;Murphy thinks you
couldn&#8217;t resist. That you finally saw your chance after failing to steal the royal lavulite
in the Hunter case&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Steele turned abruptly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t fail.&#8221; He spoke firmly, matter-of-factly, and looked
directly at her. &#8220;Somethin&#8217; else caught m&#8217; eye. I abandoned m&#8217; interest in the gems.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She couldn&#8217;t allow herself to be distracted by his meaning. &#8220;Or postponed it.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Laura, I didn&#8217;t take the ruby. Or the mosaic. You have m&#8217; word.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">His gaze burned into her. She could hear the challenge in his voice. She softened,
thinking back to that first time when he&#8217;d &#8216;given his word,&#8217; saying he&#8217;d not steal the
jewels she&#8217;d been hired to protect&nbsp;&#8211; and kept it. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what if Murphy&#8217;s initial
instincts had been right all along? What if she was being played by the con man, who&#8217;d
just been waiting for his big chance to score? She tried to shove those thoughts aside.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;One of your work crew could&#8217;ve tampered with the system.&#8221; A flash in his eyes told
her that her words had come a beat too late for him, that they were not the ones he&#8217;d
hoped to hear.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t do that, Laura.&#8221; With that, he turned and walked the few steps to the
bedroom, saying, &#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ve no further questions, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; get some sleep.&#8221;
He paused at the bedroom door. Without turning back to her, he said softly, &#8220;Thank
you for bein&#8217; here. You&#8217;re welcome t&#8217; finish the night on the sofa.&#8221; The door closed
behind him.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He was exhausted, she could tell&nbsp;&#8211; more by the way he talked than by the way he
looked, though she hadn&#8217;t often seen him with a day&#8217;s growth of beard. He only
started blunting his words during rare moments of informality, moments of intimacy&nbsp;&#8211;
or moments when he was just plain too tired to expend the effort to cover up his
natural accent with the purity of the Queen&#8217;s English.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She closed her eyes, fatigue hitting her again. She stood just outside his bedroom, her
hand on the doorknob: she would throw caution to the wind, climb into his bed, hold
him, reassure him, reassure herself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make love to him. She opened the door. He
turned to her, naked except for the medallion he always wore, of unknown
significance. He was even more beautiful out of his clothes than in them. In his hands,
those elegant hands, he held the ruby and the royal lavulite&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura&#8217;s body jerked and her eyes snapped open. She looked down at her clenched
fists, then over at Steele&#8217;s closed bedroom door. Please God, don&#8217;t let him have done
this. She got up from the couch, folded the sleeping bag, and left the apartment.</span></span></p>

<br>

secret passageway here somewhere&nbsp;&#8211; he couldn&#8217;t remember where. He had to get out!
He pressed, then pounded, the first tapestry, &#8216;The Start of the Hunt.&#8217;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The shrills of dogs eager to give chase pierced the air. He whirled and saw coarse,
heartless hunters in brilliant, multicolored liveries struggling to rein in the howling
beasts. A lymerer signaled&nbsp;&#8211; he had been sighted!</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He bolted. The hunters tracked him to a fountain. The hunters encircled him, closed
in on him, then, unaccountably, they let him escape. No! He knew what they were
doing&nbsp;&#8211; they were toying with him, prolonging the game. Other creatures&nbsp;&#8211; birds, a
stag, a lion and lioness&nbsp;&#8211; looked on, indifferent to his plight.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They chased him to a stream. Surrounded by hunters with spears, dogs at close
quarters, he frantically foiled down the waters, trying to throw off the dogs&#8217; scent. He
failed.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He savagely kicked and butted and gored the pursuing animals and people. The sound
of a hunter&#8217;s horn split the air, rallying the men for his capture.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He narrowly escaped the stealthy hunters, the relentless pack of hounds. He was
exhausted. He saw before him a maiden. She beckoned him, urged him to come to
her, offered him a safe haven. He went to her, laid his head on her lap. He looked up
at her with gratitude&nbsp;&#8211; and saw her signal the men, signing his death warrant!</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The dogs finally chased him down. The lord of the hounds flashed his hunting sword,
preparing to deliver the coup de gr&acirc;ce. Three hunters surrounded him as he made
one last attempt at escape. He screamed as they thrust their spears into his body,
immobilizing him. Four dogs sank their teeth into his flesh and held him fast. He
reared back his head; a spear pierced his throat, cutting off his cries. His body shook
with shock and terror. His legs failed him and he started sinking to the ground. His
tongue lolled. He was bleeding, dying. His last sight before his world turned to black
was that of the lord and the lady of the castle standing impassively nearby, awaiting
his slaying: his horn would be sliced off with a machete and given to them.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Then, somehow, miraculously alive and whole again, he lay chained to a circular
wooden gate in a lush garden, a happy pet, tamed by the maiden, enjoying the Garden
of Eden.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">No! Impossible! He was a trapped beast; he had to escape his captors!</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">No! He was not the unicorn. He had to <i>save</i> the unicorn! He had to get out! He ran
down the corridor pounding on each of the tapestries&nbsp;&#8211; </span></span></p>

in the bedsheets with the covers over his head. Trying to find his way out, he nearly
fell out of bed. He sat up and put a hand to his heart, willing himself to breathe, trying
to force himself out of the miasma of fear and death exhumed by his nightmare. From
a smorgasbord of languages he chose the strongest invectives he could think of to
curse his so-called cousins&nbsp;&#8211; really the children of whomever he&#8217;d been dumped with
at the time. <i>They</i> were to blame for causing the torturous pursuit of the unicorn
depicted in the tapestries to invade his dreams. <i>They </i>were to blame for the periodic
nightmares he&#8217;d suffered throughout his life. They&#8217;d delighted in terrorizing him as a
small lad with their tales of headless phantoms, pookas, banshees, ghosts, evil spirits,
and witches. Or with stories that he&#8217;d be carried off by the bad faeries who&#8217;d sacrifice
him to Satan in their yearly ceremonies. Or, worst of all, by telling him he was a
changeling child and had to prove otherwise by letting them perform the one infallible
test: they must lay him on a fire, recite the magic formula, and see if he burned. Only
a true child wouldn&#8217;t burn. More than once they&#8217;d dragged him, kicking and
screaming, to some pyre they&#8217;d built; only when he could feel the hot flames licking
his face had they loosened their grasp enough for him to escape. They&#8217;d laughed at
him as he&#8217;d wept in fear and humiliation. &#8216;Omadhaun</span></span>

game.&#8217; Each night he&#8217;d stolen a little milk and put it on the windowsill, trying to
appease the faeries, begging them to leave him alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He&#8217;d faced down more dangers in his life than he cared to recall, but prime him with a

urge for a stress-relieving chocolate bar about now. She could feel her left eyebrow
twitching. She hurriedly shoved the photo under some file folders as Bernice walked in
wearing a knowing smile. Laura ignored it and gratefully accepted her monogrammed
brown-and-black coffee mug. She took a sip and quirked an eyebrow at the
receptionist. &#8220;This is tea.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Bernice shrugged, sat on the edge of Laura&#8217;s desk, and started fiddling with her

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura leaned back in her chair, staring at the papers overlapping like snowflakes,
nearly hiding the black surface of her desk. She really should move some of these
onto Steele&#8217;s desk, whose pristine surface had never been marred by anything so
vulgar since his arrival. &#8220;Well, Murphy&#8217;s been spending the whole day interviewing the
housekeeping staff and some of the guests and the help hired for the party. Nothing
so far.&#8221; She sighed. &#8220;There were two hundred people at that party. What a chain of

<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">! I interviewed Ms. Raeder again. Got nothing helpful. She expressed her
sympathies for Mr. Steele, said she and her husband thought it ridiculous he&#8217;s
considered the prime suspect for the crime&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, from what I hear, she considers him prime something&nbsp;&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; Bernice held her palms
out as Laura shot her a look&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;hey, I&#8217;m just telling you what I heard. Anyway, that&#8217;s
not what I asked&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I contacted the local pawnshops, jewelers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fences. But I don&#8217;t think the thieves
would use them.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Bernice shook her head at Laura, evidently giving up on her original question. &#8220;Why
not?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura nodded toward Steele&#8217;s office. &#8220;He said <i>he</i> wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; As Bernice opened her
mouth to speak, Laura went on hurriedly, &#8220;They dusted the display case for
fingerprints. Found Mr. Steele&#8217;s and some of the work crew&#8217;s.&#8221; She grimaced.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, they would, wouldn&#8217;t they? That&#8217;s not suspicious.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura sat up in her chair, an edge creeping into her voice. &#8220;What&#8217;s suspicious is the
doorlock is missing. Mysteriously removed from the lockbox at the forensics lab.&#8221;
She&#8217;d checked. He&#8217;d been at the police station a long time last night, but not quite as
long as he&#8217;d claimed&nbsp;&#8211; there were several hours unaccounted for.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you think he did it? I mean all of it. The ruby, the mosaic.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura bit her lip and dropped her eyes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to think so. But it&#8217;s right up his
alley, isn&#8217;t it.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Is it?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura looked up in surprise. &#8220;Have you forgotten our introduction to him?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Bernice shrugged. &#8220;He said he was going to return the royal lavulite to the South
African government.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;After stealing it.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;True.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;He once stole &#8216;The Five Nudes of Cairo.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Twice. Once with you.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That was different.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Was it? Did you ever ask him why he stole it the first time?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No. I doubt he&#8217;d tell me the truth, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want to hear it. We know he
was mentored by a con man. We know he hunted for gold in the Yucatan&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That&#8217;s not a crime&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;No!&#8221; Laura slapped her hand on the desk. &#8220;But this is the sum total of what I know
about him. And since when are you such a big supporter of him?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Just playing the <i>devil&#8217;s</i> advocate.&#8221; Bernice grinned. Then her grin faded, and her voice
turned gentle. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not all you know about him. That&#8217;s just all you know about
before he became a regular fixture around here.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura knew what Bernice was getting at but pushed it aside, along with the memory of
what had happened in the early afternoon, when he&#8217;d seemed so vulnerable, so
stripped of pretense. &#8220;I know he&#8217;s not ready to play straight with me. I took him to
help interview Wallace&#8217;s crew&nbsp;&#8211; <i>they</i> trust him.&#8221; She heaved a sigh. &#8220;I even let him lead
the questioning, at first. He asked the right questions, though I had a few more of my
own. Afterwards, he seemed upset that because of him these men are suspects&nbsp;&#8211; &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Well, they worked on the security system, so naturally the police are interested in
them. But you were saying he&#8217;s not playing straight.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura got up and walked to the front of her desk to pace. &#8220;We&nbsp;&#8211; or at least <i>I</i>&nbsp;&#8211; learned
one of the crew has disappeared. A man named Carl. Why? Is he the accomplice, out
fencing the goods? I wish I&#8217;d paid more attention to this Raeder job.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t. Because Mr. Steele was so enthusiastic about it. And it was like the
Dillon job. So you knew he could do it. You were delighted. Said for once you could
turn your attention to other cases and give him full rein&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And maybe that was just the opportunity he was waiting for&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Would you stop that pacing? You&#8217;re driving me crazy.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Sorry.&#8221; Laura grinned sheepishly and sat back down at her desk.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Maybe it was just the chance to do something he&#8217;s good at, something where he
didn&#8217;t have to pretend to be &#8216;master detective.&#8217;&#8221; As Laura started to protest, Bernice
held up a hand. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s obvious he likes playing &#8216;Remington Steele.&#8217; But maybe it was
a relief not to pretend for a while.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And maybe he decided to just drop the pretense entirely and go back to his old
ways.&#8221; As Bernice again opened her mouth to speak, Laura cut her off. &#8220;I know, I know,
I don&#8217;t know what those were.&#8221; She stared at Bernice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know him.&#8221; Her
tone dared Bernice to disagree. &#8220;And because I wasn&#8217;t at the Raeders to keep an eye
on things, I might&#8217;ve missed something about his or the crew&#8217;s behavior that could
clear him&nbsp;&#8211; or condemn him. This missing man Carl&nbsp;&#8211; I&#8217;ve done some checking on
him. He was Wallace&#8217;s right-hand man at the Mission. Took it over when Wallace died.
He was out of town during the Dillon job, but he worked every other security job we
hired Wallace&#8217;s crew for. On the jobs before this one, I never saw him and Mr. Steele
together at all, and according to the work rosters, he did only the most menial tasks.
But on this one, according to the Raeders, Carl worked closely with Mr. Steele, hand in
hand. Why this one?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;What did Mr. Steele say?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;That Carl was the right man for the job.&#8221; Laura shook her head in dismay. &#8220;And when
we were questioning Wallace&#8217;s crew, each time I&#8217;d ask one of them about Carl, his
eyes would dart to Mr. Steele, and all I&#8217;d get was an unhelpful answer. Once I was
quick enough to catch the warning look Mr. Steele was giving. He later denied it.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;I searched Carl&#8217;s office at the Mission, hoping for credit card receipts, personal
letters, telephone bills, something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I told Mr. Steele to sit in the office chair while I
went through Carl&#8217;s stuff. His face blanked and I could tell he was offended, and then
he just sat there impassively when I wouldn&#8217;t let him leave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She looked up at Bernice. &#8220;He refused to pick the lock for me at Carl&#8217;s home. Took me
forever. And he wouldn&#8217;t open the wall safe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He just tagged along after me, silent,
looking pretty irked. &#8217;Course, I&#8217;d given him the choice of following me around not
touching anything, or being locked in a closet.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They both laughed, but without real humor.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;And of course by then, I was more than irked with him, too.&#8221; In the silence that
followed, Laura could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall behind her.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Where&#8217;s he now?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Laura looked away from the sympathy in Bernice&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;The police are interrogating
him again.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Can they do that?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Oh, legally they can&#8217;t make him go to the station and answer questions, but he
agreed to. He said, &#8216;How would it look if Remington Steele didn&#8217;t give full cooperation
with the authorities?&#8217; When I said it&#8217;d look a lot worse if he incriminated himself, he
said, &#8216;Nonsense. I shall simply tell them the truth.&#8217;&#8221; Laura slumped down in her seat.
&#8220;That&#8217;d be a first.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">She fell silent, her exasperation with Steele temporarily falling away, picturing the
scene at police headquarters. This was the 80's, and the days of rubber hoses,
protracted grilling under bright lights, and severe sleep deprivation, as portrayed in
Steele&#8217;s beloved film noir, were long gone, but intimidation, even if subtle, still ruled.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">The interrogation room: wooden table, uncomfortable chair, tape recorder. Harsh,
dreary, grim. The table as far away from the door as possible; him seated at its far
end. Far, far away from freedom.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">No windows, no intercom, no phone&nbsp;&#8211; disconnect the interrogatee, cut him off from
outside information, that was the goal. What did the police know? What had witnesses
said? What evidence had been garnered against him? Bits of misinformation would be
fed to him as answers.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They&#8217;d interrogate him for hours on end, hoping to break him, urging him to confess,

<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They&#8217;d ask questions, over and over again, covering the same ground from different
angles without giving him time to recover, in the hope of provoking contradictions.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">They&#8217;d stand, pace, loom over him; he&#8217;d be required to sit. They&#8217;d thunder, whisper,
snarl; he&#8217;d be required to answer politely.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">And then, after a long while, would come little shows of concern&nbsp;&#8211; are the lights too
bright? is the room too cold? would he like some coffee? a sandwich? They could be
generous, they could be compassionate, they could be benevolent. They could offer
him a lifeline, pull him out of this mess&nbsp;&#8211; if not quite save him. All he had to do was talk&nbsp;&#8211;
</span></span></p>

&#8217;<span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"> on TV the
other night. And anyway, for all she knew, Steele was lounging in the Chief of Police&#8217;s
office, regaling the Chief with tales of real-or-imagined derring-do. No. Not likely.
The scene in Steele&#8217;s apartment this afternoon had quashed any fantasy that the
police would treat &#8216;The Great Remington Steele&#8217; with kid gloves.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">But one thing was for sure: in any interrogation, he wouldn&#8217;t talk. At least, he wouldn&#8217;t
say what they wanted to hear. He would stick to his story, never waver in its details.
Because he was telling the truth? Or because he was just one damn good con man?
She looked up at Bernice. &#8220;He&#8217;s the logical culprit.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Now you sound like Jenkins. You ask me, that guy&#8217;s just got some bug up his a&#151;&nbsp;&#8221; Bernice broke off, and they both unsuccessfully hid smiles. &#8220;Besides, this whole thing
is too unimaginative for Mr. Steele. Remember how you got &#8216;The Five Nudes of Cairo&#8217;?
Remember his sting with Daniel? Remember spearguns and windup monster toys and
elaborate charades?&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Maybe this involves an elaborate charade, too,&#8221; Laura said morosely, sinking further
down in her chair. &#8220;The elaborate charade of being &#8216;Remington Steele.&#8217;&#8221; She ran her
hand through her hair. &#8220;Tonight I&#8217;m sending him out with Murphy on an all-night
stakeout of Carl&#8217;s home.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">&#8220;Bet Murphy will love that.&#8221;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">****</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><a name="CS7.5"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy stood looking at the Raeders&#8217; pool. He wasn&#8217;t sure what he hoped to find at
the mansion, but his motto was, &#8216;When your investigation leads you to a brick wall,
keep pounding your head against it until you bust through.&#8217; He grimaced, knowing he
was up against a man with the motto, &#8216;When you come to a brick wall, sneak around
or over it.&#8217;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy turned and started to retrace his steps of last night.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">He went into the pavilion. He stopped, his eye caught by the floor&#8217;s mandala-like
centerpiece. &#8216;This is a marquetry floor, designed by a craftsman, with hand-scraped
squares of white oak, mahogany, and satinwood,&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; Steele had told him, going on and
on&nbsp;&#8211; &#8216;each square has been hand-selected for that perfect combination of colour,
grain, and texture, each piece of wood has been individually shaped and then lain in
this decorative geometric pattern.&#8217; Steele had been practically hopping up and down
with delight as he&#8217;d viewed the room. &#8216;Jesus,&#8217; Murphy had thought, &#8216;all that money on
a damn floor.&#8217;</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy continued through the pavilion. He brushed past the hoity-toity artcase
Steinway concert grand piano with its intricate carvings and expensive wood inlay,
past the fancy-dancy cabinet of copperplate works, past a huge, grotesque bronze
urn, past a settee covered with a tapestry of silk and wool threads&nbsp;&#8211; surely no one
would ever sit on that thing. Finally, he passed a monstrous sideboard of mahogany.
Porcelain plaques were inserted into the wood; it was gilded in bronze and topped
with marble. All these little things Murphy knew because Steele had given him and
Laura a grand tour of the mansion, eager to point out everything in excruciating
detail.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy exited the pavilion and went into the Glass Room, filled with old glass. &#8216;Old
glass!&#8217; Steele had exclaimed. &#8216;Why, Murphy, this room is filled with Venetian glass,
baroque glass, collections of porcelain, faience, tin, and more.&#8217; Yeah, yeah, Steele. Old
glass.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy stared at the door to the Jewelry Room. Even Steele had been startled, the
words he&#8217;d been speaking frozen on his lips, at his first glimpse of the treasures in
this room. Words had been frozen on Murphy&#8217;s lips, too, but he was sure they weren&#8217;t
the same ones. Why did the rich waste all their money on these goo-ga&#8217;s ? Think of all
the good they could do with that money.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Murphy snorted his disgust, then headed into the front hall, with its fluted white
marble ionic columns&nbsp;&#8211; as Steele had painstakingly enlightened him. He briefly flicked
his eyes east toward the Porcelain Foyer, filled with more old glass&nbsp;&#8211; oh, excuse him,
Bohemian engraved glass&nbsp;&#8211; before turning toward the alarm system&#8217;s command
console. Careful examination revealed nothing of interest. He then started up the
stairs to that Museum Room filled with pieces that should&#8217;ve been available for public
viewing instead of tucked away in this egotistic monument to Raeder&#8217;s wealth.</span></span></p>


<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">Two hours later, he went back out to his car, discouraged. No startling revelations. No
new clues. All he had were suspicions.</span></span></p>
