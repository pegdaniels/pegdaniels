<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif">1) I got information about the Unicorn Tapestries from </span></span><a href="http://www.unicornlady.net"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.unicornlady.net </span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">.
There are many additional sites that I visited to learn about the tapestries.
</span></span></span><a href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/eliot/452/tapestry.html"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">http://victorian.fortunecity.com/eliot/452/tapestry.html </span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">has some great pictures of
them.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">&#8216;The Unicorn Tapestries&#8217; is a real book, but I made up the part about what the caption
on the seventh tapestry is.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">2) Info about Admiral Raeder&#8217;s naval dirks is from
</span></span></span><a href="http://www.wwiidaggers.com/SPO.htm"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.wwiidaggers.com/SPO.htm</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000"> (Note: I wrote the above in late 2003 or early
2004 and recently noticed that information is gone from that site. Apparently the dirk
described there has been sold.)</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">3) The paintings and Walter Scott novels that Mr. Steele helped fictionally recover are
all real (not the royal lavulite mosaic, of course, though see B. below) and have the
histories given in that first hospital scene where Laura shows Murphy her notes. In
actuality, however, they were recovered at much later dates than 1983, the time of
this story. I suppose someone stole them again after Mr. Steele aided the police. He
claims not to be responsible for that, however. :-)</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">A. &#8220;Water Lilies, 1904.&#8221; Monet. Recovered in 1998:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">During a 1998 visit to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Jonathan Petropoulos, the
art and cultural property research director for the Presidential Advisory Commission
on Holocaust Assets, recognized Monet&#8217;s &#8220;Water Lilies, 1904.&#8221; Taken from French art
dealer Paul Rosenberg, the painting was part of a collection amassed for Nazi Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in 1941. The Monet had been registered in a French
museum as an unclaimed stolen work and traveled to the U.S. as part of a special
exhibition, &#8220;Monet in the 20th Century.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">B. Walter Scott novels stolen by Hitler&#8217;s army from the study of Tsar Alexander I in the
Yekaterinsky Palace have never been recovered. Neither have most of the contents of the
palace&#8217;s famed eighteenth century &#8220;Amber Room,&#8221; which was dismantled by the
Germans. In a further search on that topic, I came up with the fact that amber mosaics
had been stolen. Of course, none were encrusted with royal lavulite. In 2000, ending years of wrangling, Germany returned to Russia one of two known pieces from the Amber Room, an intricate mosaic made of amber. Also included in the return was an early chest of drawers that was part of the room's original furnishings. The name &#8220;Amber Room&#8220; came from the splendid panels of amber that originally lined the walls of the room.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">C. &#8220;Portrait of Christ.&#8221; Jacopo de Barbari. Recovered in 1999:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">The painting not only has the history mentioned in the hospital scene, but also the
history told by Mando to Desco at their first meeting in this story, up until the point
where it got into the hands of the furniture restorer. In actuality, the furniture
restorer, Frank J. Vaccaro, was arrested and sentenced to community service after
trying to sell it back to the Weimar city museum, from where it had originally been
stolen, for a finder&#8217;s fee.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">D. D&uuml;rer drawing. Two of his drawings, as well as a drawing by Rembrandt, all
recovered in 2001, have the history mentioned by Mando to Desco during their
second meeting in this story. Actually, after being at the Baku Museum in Azerbaijan,
they were stolen once again and ultimately wound up in the hands of a Japanese
wrestler who was trying to raise money for a kidney transplant! I decided that might
sound too unbelievable if I put that into the story. The drawings have been returned to
the Bremen Museum in Germany from where they were originally stolen.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">4) &#8220;The Portrait of Pastor Adrianus Tegularius.&#8221;  Frans Hals. Recovered 1990. It never
belonged to anyone named Goldschmidt. Below are some facts about it.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">This painting&#8217;s recovery generated some controversy:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">From <i>Art in America</i>, Sept, 2001, by Raphael Rubinstein:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">On July 6, a French court convicted Adam Williams, former head of Newhouse Galleries
in New York, for handling a stolen painting, Frans Hals's &#8216;Portrait of Pastor Adrianus
Tegularius (1655-60),&#8217; which was taken by the Nazis from Paris art collector Adolphe
Schloss in 1943. The Hals was sold at auction in New York and London several times
in the 1960s and '70s without the knowledge of the Schloss heirs. In 1989, Williams
bought it at Christie's in London for $180,000. The following year he took the painting
to an art fair in Paris, where it was recognized by one of the heirs and confiscated by
the police. Williams claims to have been unaware of the painting's illicit history, but
French prosecutors charged that its provenance was well known. After the
British-born dealer was acquitted at his first trial, the decision was appealed. Williams
faced up to five years in prison, but the court gave him an eight-month suspended
sentence and ordered the Hals to be turned over to Adolphe Schloss's heirs.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">5) Re the Braque painting and faked provenance (although the following story takes
place after the events in my fictional one, the principle holds):</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">A 20th-Century Master Scam.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Source: <i>New York Times Magazine </i>(0028-7822); Volume: 148; Issue: 51587; Date:
1999</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">The July 18<sup>th</sup>, 1999 issue of the NY Times Magazine has an article exposing art forger
John Myatt. Myatt, a local art teacher in England, discovered in 1986 that he has an
amazing ability to paint in the style of numerous 20th century masters such as Braque,
Picasso, and Klee. Enter a con artist named John Drewe, who began to sell Myatt's
work through various major auction houses and galleries. Drewe was a brilliant forger
himself, in that he looted museum libraries and national archives for material that
would permit the creation of seemingly ironclad provenances. The scheme toppled
when a former lover of Drewe's tipped off Scotland Yard about Drewe's activities.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Myatt apparently produced some 200 works, many of which sold for tens and even
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Due in part to Drewe's clever bogus provenances,
numerous art experts failed to notice that all of Myatt's works were done in ordinary
acrylic housepaint mixed with KY Jelly.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">The many formidable lines of defense were easily breached: art experts, museums,
galleries, dealers, and archive curators were all fooled. The article notes some experts
believe that anywhere from 10% to 40% of works by significant artists for sale are
fakes.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Though what I put into this story as Jack Ritt&#8217;s story may sound fantastic, the process
of his forgeries is closely based upon what Drewe actually did. (Other things like foul
play, etc., are purely a fabrication of my twisted imagination.) And wouldn&#8217;t you know
it, someone else thought this an interesting story, too&nbsp;&#8211; I understand it&#8217;s going to be
made into a movie. I guess they won&#8217;t listen to me if I tell them they can&#8217;t&nbsp;&#8211; I had the
idea to use it in my story first!</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">I am not, however, implying that anything like these events involved LACMA in any
way&nbsp;&#8211; that is pure fiction on my part.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">6) You can see the Horch at </span></span></span><a href="http://www.bellesdantan.com/Horch/Pages/Horch1.htm"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.bellesdantan.com/Horch/Pages/Horch1.htm</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000"></span></span></span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">7) The remarks about John Hewitt that Nevan shied away from are a paraphrase of a
snatch of a comment made by Barra &Oacute; S&eacute;aghdha while reviewing &#8216;In the Chair:
Interviews with Poets from the North of Ireland.&#8217; (Jonn Brown, ed., Salmon 2002).</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">I had a lot of fun doing research for this story. It&#8217;s amazing what one can pick up on
the web. Information about:</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Rubies. Clothing. Unicorns. Irish and German Folk Tales. Nazi handguns. Mansions
and castles. LACMA and its movie schedules (had to call to find they don&#8217;t sell
concessions, though &lt;g&gt; ). Landscaping in L.A. The sights in L.A. Con schemes.
Artwork. Nazi plundering of artwork. Provenance research (see LACMA&#8217;s site, for example). Binoculars. How alarm systems and motion
sensors work. How to cut power to a house, pick locks, and break into safes. Tree
climbing. Aerial ropeways. What type of searches and interrogation police can do
when. Handcuffing procedures. How injured arrestees are treated and where (thanks
to a reply by the Beverly Hills Police Department). What real private investigators do in
an investigation. The fact that a forensics lab can determine if a lock has been picked.
Dogs. Symptoms of infection of dog bites and how they&#8217;re treated. Road maps. How
long a D.A. in CA has to bring charges. What videotapes were available when. What
soap operas were on in 1983. Etc.</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Anyway, I tried to go for accuracy as much as I was able, though I admit to some
fudging. For example, I don&#8217;t know if Steele would be awarded those recovery fees
and didn&#8217;t want to find out he wouldn&#8217;t. In any case, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have gotten
them that quickly. I don&#8217;t know if the mayor would have held a reception for him. I
doubt &#8220;Nurse Ratched&#8221; could really keep a bunch of reporters away from Steele&#8217;s
bedside. I also don&#8217;t know what kind of wards are at the Medical Center at the L.A.
County Jail. I did find out that such facilities are generally of one of two types:
prisoners are in small locked rooms unrestrained, or they&#8217;re in larger wards
handcuffed to steel bars. I couldn&#8217;t get through to this one in particular. I always got a
voice message when I called, saying the operators were all busy, and when I wrote
them, no one replied (no e-mail address). I decided it wasn&#8217;t worth any more effort and so chose the one better for the story. I decided it&#8217;d be easier to get Laura onto a
ward than into a locked room. Assuming, of course, she could get into either!</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', sans-serif"><span style="color: #000000">Again, I make no claim of infallibility, so if you are sure some &#8216;fact&#8217; is wrong, let me
know and I will look into it. Unless, of course, it&#8217;s something I consciously took
creative license with: there are some other things I consciously fudged but am not
telling you about. :-)</span></span></span></p>
