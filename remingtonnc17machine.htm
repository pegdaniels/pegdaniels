<p style="text-align: center">The Remington NC-17 Machine, constructed by Peg Daniels</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Try this for a deep, dark, dripping secret: there exists a simple machine for generating RS NC-17
stories. Follow: I'd always loved, um, excitement, so I studied and apprenticed, and gave myself
license to write smut. But absolutely no one came! Then I was opened to a penetrating insight,
and I invented a machine. A decidedly masculine machine. Suddenly there were readers lined up
around my block! It works like a charm. So now that I&#8217;ve done the work, you can use my
machine in your stories and take the bows. As long as people buy it, this machine can get the job
done. Remember: in writing your descriptions, never replace the mechanics of the sex act with
subtle allusions. Well . . . almost never. If you do, you won&#8217;t need my machine.</p>
<br>
<p>*****</p>
<br>
<p>The Remington NC-17 machine:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Remington inserted his (choose from: tongue, finger, throbbing male organ of pleasuring)</p>
<br>
<p>into Laura's (choose from: ear; mouth; warm, wet center of her femininity).</p>
<br>
<p>*****</p>
<br>
<p>A simple combinatorial calculation shows that this gives 9 possibilities for description of their
love-making. And of course, we can construct a similar machine for Laura. If you&#8217;re feeling
creative, you can expand the inputs allowed as Remington and Laura put out. As Markos was
quoted in <i>Red Holt Steele</i>, "Think of the possibilities!" On the other hand, some things are best
left to the imagination, and in these situations it will suffice for you to write &#8220;Remington inserted
his Tab A into Laura&#8217;s Slot B.&#8221;</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you find this of some help when your thrust is to write the perfect love scene.</p>
